build-data-science-team,116,"This is a great course and a daring venture for what is really an art form, beyond it's scientific requirements. This part of the specialization needs a little refinement.I posted this in the discussion forum.· 7 days ago · EditedFirst of all.....these guys running this data science department have their hands full. They are teaching live classes for students who have spent OODLES (lots) of money to attend this prestigious college . Johns Hopkins is about as good as it gets for a medical degree. Then they are doing experiments and other data science for the research division of Johns Hopkins which is also as good as it gets........THEN they are doing these MOOC courses on top of all their other responsibilities......Dr. Leek is a University of Washington Alumni, which is also top notch for Data Science.The video lesson is flawed, there is no denying it. But I must say these teachers are very open to improvement in the course and your comments on what could be better done are received and acted upon, so I would include them in your thank you letter to the teachers.ALSO I think these MOOC courses are best done by all members of the department contributing. Truly this field IS a team sport. I feel this course was good, but the videos need to be edited and scripted, so unnecessary language, which dilutes the core knowledge, that must be learned, is not diluted where questions are left in the students head about content when being tested. I learned long ago in a college calculus class that if your mark isn't perfect, it's OK, so long as you pass with a high score......even if it is the teachers fault. The course could use better video production with teleprompter scripting......maybe some AV students at Johns Hopkins could get on board. it will happen eventually I'm sure.You want to take a course that is absolutely one of the best courses I've taken anywhere and truly the best online. Try the number one business course on Coursera:GROW TO GREATNESS, either part 1 or 2, University of Virginia, Darden School Of Business...........A team created course with one helluva a teacher who is a business person, researcher and award-winning writer. I would recommend this course to ANY student and especially E-Teachers.The problem with this course is that there is a lot of information that can be included but may not be absolutely necessary as a ""core concept"". Needless to say, the more technical skills any employee has, the more insight they will have into their teammate's skills, as well, as the overall mission of the data department and the business it serves. I'm more of a tech and infrastructure person, I'm not real passionate about coding. I find it tedious. The more I learn about it, the more I enjoy it, albeit, from a distance. I can't see myself creating great blocks of scripts, but the more I know about how they are created AND what rules the code in a project must abide by, the better my skills will be as a data center manager. So I'm trying to learn as much as possible about R, Python, and companion programs like ggvis for creating visualizations. I'd say visualizations are an essential skill for a data manager, since you have to present results and projects, questions, and answers to higher ups and other departments.this link comes from the resource section of this course:https://www.datacamp.com/courses/ggvis-data-visualization-r-tutorialThis link or URL is of much more value to me, than a flawed test question and a reduction in my 100 percent average in the specialization.Without this lesson, in this course, I would not have this valuable resource.Another great link, which has a great FREE print publication as well:http://www.processor.com/ ...these people have been advising data center managers longer than just about anybody !Verbally and in the transcript are some nebulous statements that point toward the main idea, that concept being: the more any employee, on any data science or technical team member IS, a ""jack of all trades"", the better. So that could have been included in some more general way on the quiz, because really that is pretty much a general rule, I've found, working in ANY capacity in the tech industry. I have done a great deal of audio editing, working at numerous radio stations, with Adobe Audition. With others like: Pro Tools, or any other really good quality AV digital editor the result is streamlined, near seamless, audio-video, or one or the other. You just learn how to read and edit wave forms of all kinds.Years ago, in Dallas, Texas, attending Richland College. I learned a valuable lesson. I was taking a college level Calc-Trig math class being taught by the regular professor's WIFE. I don't know if the professor was sick, but this woman, who was teaching the class for the whole semester, frankly, was not qualified. I had always been considered an illiterate by my high school math teachers, a married couple who, frankly, were highly abnormal even on the geekiest scale. These people were acting like they were a world above most people in the class. Needless to say, I assumed, by their ""adult"" opinions, they were sent by God Himself, to educate me thru denigration.I was amazed, how 10 years later, in College math how well I was doing. I was carrying a 100 percent average ! So midterm this faux professor declares, ""I'll be prefiguring all the arithmetic to be easy, so you won't have to bring your calculators !""SO I DIDN'T.......and of course the teacher's wife proclaims.....""I didn't have time to make the arithmetic easy so you'd better use your calculators !"" I literally had pages and pages of figuring in handwriting accompanying my 3 page test. The result was a C plus on the test. I angrily told the sub teacher ""I did not bring a calculator to this test because you said it wouldn't be necessary, therefore I must be allowed to redo this test with a calculator !"" She of course relented, ""No that won't be possible...that's not a bad grade...."" she continued, ""what are you worried about ?""........I was so peeved, I was going to drop the class. It was too late in the semester, and I was so disgusted with this woman's cavalier dismissal of my perfect grade that I just stopped going to class. The result was a failing final grade.Who ultimately suffered from this dilemma ? That, albeit, unfairly was me.....who created this ""academic"" tragedy, by the aggravation of a deeply flawed situation.

data-science-project,538,"The main reason for my rating is because the course is so ""loose"" on what your are supposed to achieve incrementally every week that it can lead to some hard situations.Just to give my example: the first week was piece of cake and I didn't feel like it really contribute for the following weeks. Then, I was struggling with the suggested library (tm) until I got support through the discussion forums and someone suggested me to use quanteda.Then thinks started to run smoothly, or so I thought. When implementing the language model (which, at first, I thought was supposed to be KBO), I got stuck for a long period. Not because my model was wrong (I was able to implement it and to check it against some hand-written and proved examples - which I should probably thank again), but because I was not able to make it run efficiently enough for the given constraints.Being stuck in this stage for longer than I wanted, I had to sacrifice another important steps of data analysis pipeline in order to not jeopardize my final delivery by not meeting the final due date. I know that this is exactly what will happen in the ""real"" life, but I think that some better guidance could guarantee the students spent a more even amount of time in across all steps.All things considered, I think the Capstone was really interesting and likely took more than the 4-9 hours per week, but most of this is probably because of the problems I faced.I believe that with a better guidance on the paths to follow or maybe some suggested libraries to use, a lot of ""noise"" (useless difficulty) could be removed and this course would definitely get more starts.",3,"['main reason rating course loose supposed', 'achieve incrementally every week lead hard situations', 'give example first week piece cake', ""didn't feel like really contribute following weeks"", 'struggling suggested library tm got support', 'discussion forums someone suggested use quanteda', 'thinks started run smoothly thought', 'implementing language model first thought supposed kbo got stuck long period', 'not model wrong able implement check', 'hand written proved examples probably thank', 'not able make run efficiently enough given constraints', 'stuck stage longer wanted sacrifice another important steps', 'data analysis pipeline order not jeopardize', 'final delivery not meeting final due date', 'know exactly happen real life think', 'better guidance could guarantee students spent even amount time across steps', 'things considered think capstone really interesting', 'likely took 4 9 hours per week probably problems faced', 'believe better guidance paths follow maybe', 'suggested libraries use lot noise useless difficulty could', 'removed course would definitely get starts']"

data-science-project,571,"This was essentially a self-study project with some social peers. The topic, approach, and standards were different from all of the other units in the Data Science specialization. I found the other units more enjoyable.Learning the essentials of NLP quickly is necessary to begin the project. I ordered a textbook, for example, and I was fortunate that it arrived quickly. If NLP is a prerequisite for this capstone project - whether in the form of a prior class or textbook knowledge - this should be indicated clearly on the course description page.Nevertheless, the main learning that I achieved with this course was in the area of software engineering - specifically, how to take advantage of vectorization in R to achieve reasonable computing performance. While this is a valuable skill, it doesn't seem the proper focus of a capstone course in a sequence focused primarily on other topics.As noted elsewhere in these comments, there was a complete absence of any traditional teaching support. Learning outcomes suffered as result. The missing resources included instructors, mentors, partners, and learning materials.The course site notes an expected time requirement of a few hours per week. My commitment was 20 hours per week, under some pressure. Numerous students take this ""course"" multiple time, in order to arrange for reasonable software development time.Producing working software was fun, as it always is. The course learner community was supportive, which is fortunately typical for Coursera.All in all, this project was *not* an effective capstone for the Data Science specialization.

data-science-project,573,"As a capstone to a series of courses that covered data science and R, I found this one to be a bit lacking. There was no involvement from the professors at JHU or the folks at SwiftKey. As was mentioned in another review, the course feels abandoned. All you get a few short (two minutes or so) videos that give you little in the way of instruction or direction. Basically, they just say, ""Go do this. Good luck!""There were also no Mentors or TAs to guide students or answer questions. It was the students helping each other through the forums. Sometimes it was helpful and everyone involved learned something. Other times, it was the blind trying to lead the visually-impaired.On a positive note, you will use all of the skills from the previous courses: writing R functions, performing exploratory analysis and publishing it via RPubs. Your final product will be displayed for everyone via ShinyApps and a presentation using R Presentation (also published via RPubs).On a(nother) negative note, the topic of Natural Language Processing is not an easy one to just walk into and feel confident in providing a working next-word prediction algorithm in about eight (8) weeks. You're reading academic journal articles, watching multiple videos from another Coursera course (which actually focuses on the topic of NLP, and takes place over several courses and several months!).Supposedly, there is work going on to update the course, so hopefully future students will get a better experience. I did take a bit away from this course, especially since I made more than one attempt to complete it. However, it was definitely a shock to find myself missing those things that one typically finds in a learning environment -- descriptive background, assistance to problems, etc. -- and seeing that I was for all intents and purposes on my own. Even in the professional world of data analysis, I have never experienced the lack of support that I found in this course.With that, I am giving it three (3) stars.

datasciencemathskills,641,"This course is very strong with respect to presenting the concepts you need to know for data science. It is extremely WEAK in terms explaining those concepts. If you are like me and did this kind of math back in the 70's and 80's but have not used it since, be prepared to seek sources outside Coursera in order to understand the material and pass the quizzes. The instructors leave out explanations and skip important points leaving you confused about the concept.Example: In the Permutations and Combinations sections, ""results"" of calculations are thrown at you with no explanation of how the instructor got the answer. 10 minutes later, totally as an aside, you get the explanation. The course is not taught in such a way that A leads to B, B leads to C, and C leads.....; instead the instructor will tell you about C, might explain A, and forget about mentioning B until the graded quiz. That is why you will need to fill in the gaps using websites like betterexplained.com or kahnacademy.com.The student is better served by looking at the syllabus and then going to either of those sites - where the explanations are worth your time.In addition to failing to present steps in a logical order, the course often teaches at an extremely basic level but tests at a much, much higher level. Again, to get to the higher level of understanding needed to pass ANY of the required, graded quizzes, the student will need to heavily utilize outside sources. The explanations on the practice quizzes also fail in many cases to thoroughly explain why an answer is correct.Then there are the issues with Coursera itself, the course navigation using Chrome is quite bad. If I did not constantly monitor what part of a course I should be in versus what part of the course automatically loaded next, I often found myself taking a quiz for which no lectures had been presented. The TA's response to my complaint was flippant and WRONG. She then closed my question and I could not respond or ask for more details.If I had it to do over again I would invest my time and money somewhere else. In my opinion, Coursera should rescind the instructors' rights to charge for this course until the instructors improve and meet higher teaching standards.",1,"['course strong respect presenting concepts need know data science', 'extremely weak terms explaining concepts', ""like kind math back 70's 80's"", 'not used since prepared seek sources outside coursera order understand material pass quizzes', 'instructors leave explanations skip important points leaving confused concept', 'example permutations combinations sections results calculations', 'thrown no explanation instructor got answer', '10 minutes later totally aside get explanation', 'course not taught way leads b b leads c c leads', 'instead instructor tell c might explain forget mentioning b graded quiz', 'need fill gaps using websites like betterexplained', 'com or kahnacademy', 'com', 'student better served looking syllabus going either sites explanations worth time', 'addition failing present steps logical order', 'course often teaches extremely basic level tests much much higher level', 'get higher level understanding needed pass', 'required graded quizzes student need heavily utilize outside sources', 'explanations practice quizzes also fail many cases thoroughly explain answer correct', 'issues coursera course navigation using chrome quite bad', 'not constantly monitor part course versus', 'part course automatically loaded next often found taking quiz no lectures presented', ""ta's response complaint flippant wrong"", 'closed question could not respond ask details', 'would invest time money somewhere else', ""opinion coursera rescind instructors' rights charge"", 'course instructors improve meet higher teaching standards']"

machine-learning,1160,"This was a very enjoyable introduction to and overview of machine learning, from the perspective of someone who doesn't want all of the detailed mathematical justification for the machine learning algorithms, but does want to see the nuts and bolts of how they are implemented. For example, we don't prove that we have the partial derivatives of the cost functions (or, even, really justify what partial derivatives *are*), but we do see how they are used as the input to gradient descent routines which let us optimise systems such as linear regression. It is an ideal course to use as a springboard for different aspects of machine learning, such as the Neural Networks course which is also on Coursera.The main lecturer is clear, and does a very good job of explaining some of the practical aspects of machine learning, and when you might choose the different optimisation techniques.",5,"['enjoyable introduction overview machine learning perspective', 'someone want detailed mathematical justification machine learning algorithms want see nuts bolts implemented', ""example don't prove partial derivatives cost functions"", 'even really justify partial derivatives see', 'used input gradient descent routines let us optimise systems linear regression', 'ideal course use springboard different aspects', 'machine learning neural networks course also coursera', 'main lecturer clear good job explaining', 'practical aspects machine learning might choose different optimisation techniques']"

Professor Andrew Ng is a great teacher - he makes complex algorithms and concepts very lucid and easy to understand, especially for people with no ML/ AI background. The course is very well structured and gives useful practical tips. It does get quite intense at times, especially the vectorization parts in the programming assignments - but the Discussion Forums are a huge help. Many thanks to all the mentors, especially Tom Mosher for his guidance and valuable insights. Two small pieces of feedback -I ended up spending a lot more time on the programming assignments than on the videos themselves.The concepts were clear but the vectorization really made it very difficult to complete the assignments. Is it possible to use some other package instead of Matlab/ Octave, which is perhaps a little more high level and has functionality to do most of the stuff?The second suggestion/ feedback is : I found the time estimates to be very aggressive for a beginner with no ML/ Octave background. So, most of my study planning would routinely get off track. Not sure if most of the people taking this course found them to be OK.Is there a way to download Professor Ng's lecture notes for future reference? Not all the information is present on the slides.

The content is not easy, and requires a fair bit of mathematical sophistication, but not so much to lose me, and hard enough to keep me engaged. I really enjoy how each learning unit builds off of the previous one, for instance, linear regression become logistic regression which becomes a neural network.That being said, I really think that this course needs to have a fresh coat of paint on it. I believe it was filmed in 2008. I don't think the content really has been revamped since its release. The recordings look like they were filmed on an old web cam, not even as good as a modern iPhone. The slides should have some design work on them. I know it seems petty to stress over the presentation, but I think many people are turning to programs from Udacity that are very flashy, but not as technically rigorous mainly, I feel, just because of the presentation.

Keeping up with the weeks is 5-6 hours per week, which is almost adding another work day.In the first 3 months that I was registered I completed 5 lessons. I only completed the whole course by doing a binge where I completed 7 weeks in 6 days. From other friends experiences doing a binge was the only way they got through Coursera courses as well.If you are not familiar with statistics or programming I think you will have to cover a lot of outside material just to read all the mathematical notation and do the basic programming exercises.Although I manage to pass the exercises every week I'm not sure how much of the material is necessarily well embedded in my brain, rather than I just learned it for 24 hours.

The programming exercises are very carefully designed to help students with the algorithms, while leaving the details of other programming components, which are very very very important to keep students on speed. 4.

Though I had been exposed to algorithms like k-means, SVM, PCA, and regression before, it was good to see a unified treatment of all the subjects.The video lectures are good. In the early weeks I felt a bit overwhelmed by new information, but by the end of the session I was feeling that the lectures were being stretched out. In particular, I started noticing the professor would repeat every point 2 or 3 times. That may be a good style in general, but I found it time-wasting.The quizzes were good, but a few of the questions here and there were phrased poorly, in an ambiguous manner that made it hard to understand what exactly was being asked. One questioned used vocabulary we hadn't been introduced to. (Sorry, I don't remember in which unit this happened - it wasn't a big deal at the time.)I enjoyed the programming assignments the most and, quite frankly, lost interest at the end when there were no more to be done. Most of them were challenging - at least if you avoided using the tutorials which really take you through every step. I found the SVM programming assignment thin - we really didn't do anything there except multiply a couple matrices.I have mixed feelings about the transcripts that accompany the videos. On the one hand, they are very helpful for skipping ahead when one sees a certain idea repeated 3 or 4 times. On the other hand, they are obviously automatically generated and riddled with errors.

I'm really happy that I've been exposed to it, though, and it's pretty impressive how much computation you can express in one or two lines of Matlab.I only had to use the forums once at the beginning to figure out why I couldn't submit assignments. (It turned out that my version of Octave was too new for what the assignments had been tested with.) Once I got that sorted out, I never had to go back there for help, which I thought was a good sign that the assignments were clear and had been through sufficient testing by the staff.It's certainly a bit of a time commitment. I would probably budget at least 5 hours per week. I took a lot of notes, so I paused/rewound the videos a bunch, so it took longer for me to ""watch"" the videos than the advertised time.Again, the assignments were often not that much code, and I think they started to take me less time as I progressed through the course as I got more familiar with Octave and the style of the assignments. They aren't there to trick you or separate the wheat from the chaff: they're really there to reinforce the concepts from lecture and have you write some code yourself so you have some chance of writing your own code for your own project machine learning project one day.If anything, the assignments provide much more help than I expected. That is, if this were an in-person course where I could go to office hours or whatever if I got stuck, I would expect the assignments to provide less scaffolding and to force you to struggle quite a bit on your own more. (Maybe I just have bad flashbacks to undergrad or something.)",5,"['would definitely recommend course', 'impressed quality lectures', 'professor ng uses medium well', 'easy follow content solid', 'assignments also good', 'provide ton scaffolding rarely write lot', 'code never used matlab like awhile since', 'taken linear algebra also true thinking', 'terms vectorization takes bit getting used', 'really happy exposed though pretty impressive', 'much computation express one two lines matlab', ""use forums beginning figure couldn't submit assignments"", 'turned version octave new assignments tested', 'got sorted never go back help', 'thought good sign assignments clear sufficient testing staff', 'certainly bit time commitment', 'would probably budget least 5 hours per week', 'took lot notes paused rewound videos', 'bunch took longer watch videos advertised time', 'assignments often not much code think', 'started take less time progressed course got familiar octave style assignments', ""aren't trick separate wheat chaff really"", 'reinforce concepts lecture write code chance', 'writing code project machine learning project one day', 'anything assignments provide much help expected', 'person course could go office hours', 'whatever got stuck would expect assignments', 'provide less scaffolding force struggle quite bit', 'maybe bad flashbacks undergrad something', ')']"

machine-learning,3945,"I thought, looking at the syllabus that the course will be somewhat easy for me with previous Econometrics training at graduate level. It turned up to be on par with the pace I could take it (about recommended time 1-2 hours video, 3 hours programming a week, sometimes more for exercises), and provided quite a few new insights and accessible, very intuitive introduction to many methods, algorithms, and approaches in Machine Learning. While initially I thought it was unfortunate for Andrew to have glossed so many times over details (while explicitly apologizing), I realize that that is inevitable choice between breadth and depth. At the end I would agree with the balance chosen.For my taste, I still miss the approach of mainstream Econometrics of treating every model as hypothesis (which is in the name of function in this class, but not more than that) but then testing it with the data at hand, and having a chance at rejecting it at certain level of statistical significance -- I believe not having this misses the significant chunk of scientific approach. I realize the goal is automation of much of human work in this process, but I still do not feel the balance is found. Miss any formal statistical assessment of the goodness of fit, like R-squared. At the same time I realize that I may still need to reconcile some mainstream training with new techniques.Would definitely recommend this class a really good introduction with good balance of depth and breadth to get you on the fast lane to learning the Machine Learning. Not sure if that makes you an expert -- but gives you a really good, sizable first step in that direction.",4,"['thought looking syllabus course somewhat easy previous econometrics training graduate level', 'turned par pace could take recommended time 1 2 hours video 3 hours programming', 'week sometimes exercises provided quite new insights', 'accessible intuitive introduction many methods algorithms approaches machine learning', 'initially thought unfortunate andrew glossed many times', 'details explicitly apologizing realize inevitable choice breadth depth', 'end would agree balance chosen', 'taste still miss approach mainstream econometrics', 'treating every model hypothesis name function', 'class not testing data hand chance', 'rejecting certain level statistical significance believe not misses significant chunk scientific approach', 'realize goal automation much human work', 'process still not feel balance found', 'miss formal statistical assessment goodness fit like r squared', 'time realize may still need reconcile mainstream training new techniques', 'would definitely recommend class really good introduction', 'good balance depth breadth get fast lane learning machine learning', 'not sure makes expert gives really good sizable first step direction']"

However, in later weeks, as the assignments grew more complex, I became a monkey. In the earlier weeks there was a focus on the fundamentals, which while very frustrating, are necessary to cement your skills. Later weeks failed to keep this up and emphasized increasingly isolated problems where it wasn't necessary to understand the big picture, and you can succeed (still with frustration) using blind guessing and transposing matrices. The problem with this method is that real life does not always have an assured solution.

While this makes it an excellent introductory course in Machine Learning and at the same time still applicable there are a few drawbacks. Your actual understanding of ML will be pretty shallow. Programming examples do to a certain extent facilitate understanding of the algorithms in use, but it's somewhat hard translating to real world use due to fairly heavy amount of abstraction and ""code-hiding"". Still, I would recommend this course as a starter course for ML as it will greatly enhance your understanding for ML in general and where to go next.",4,"['course without almost prerequisite knowledge requirements', 'makes excellent introductory course machine learning time still applicable drawbacks', 'actual understanding ml pretty shallow', 'programming examples certain extent facilitate understanding', 'algorithms use somewhat hard translating real world use due', 'fairly heavy amount abstraction code hiding', 'still would recommend course starter course', 'ml greatly enhance understanding ml general go next']"

What it lacks on Coursera is the next stage of this course where we could investigate further the technologies presented but in more technical way. Maybe we might see that in the future...Regarding course supports (videos, forums ...), they are of good quality and the fact Andrew used them by drawing on slides helps to have a better understanding. We could notice that there are few minor errors (eg: a ""j"" index which becomes ""i"" in J(theta) writing) and I think the technical slides on Back propagation could be improved if a dedicated slide to used mathematical notations / definitions. Sometimes, there are some errors which could induce some confusions. But these minors errors don't hide the impressive work done by Andrew.Regarding assessments, quizzes could be tricky if you don't got the ""spirit"" (not an exam habit in France) and coding exercises are well structured in order the student will focus on the core modules of the lesson and not on information flow.

You will developing your own neural networks from the scratch. Below are the pros and not pros (i won't call it cons) that i experienced.PROs :Gets onto topics right away.Information about practical implementationDoable. Not too difficult and not downright easy. You have to put effort if you do not have backgroud in undergraduate mathematics to understand the concepts.Prof. Andrew Ng. - He has knack of explaining something very complex in a very easy manner. Also, he justifies if he is not going to explain somethingAssignments evaluation and practical scenarios.Not PROs :Very High Level : This course does NOT go in detail to explain the derivations and mathematics behind machine learning course. I think its OK and that is what makes the course doable. I find it really hard to accept a formula if the reasons are not known and hence, sometimes our only task was to learn the formula. For example : in SVMs.What Next :It is just a feedback. I think at the end of course, course team should guide students, what do to next. May be which course can be a good follow up course for this.So, at the end, i just want to thanks Coursera team, Stanford Team, mentors, peers and Prof. Andrew Ng for spreading this knowledge for free.

I am familiar with the related material so it was not a great deal to me but I guess if you don't know linear algebra this could be frustrating.There are some glitches in the lectures - sentences repeating.

Also, I must admit I got a rush from implementing my first neural network, even though it was a lot simpler than I assumed it would be.

machine-learning,5410,"Great hands on exercises and very clearly explained material. Was a bit slow for me I had to watch it at 2x: perhaps the simplest maths should be factored out into a separate mini course and assume a certain background for this one. The course is rather broad, though I was surprised not to hear once about Bayes or Markov (n-grams, HMM etc.). It might be a good idea to create a specialisation consisting of a separate basic maths part, all the methods presented here, methods applicable to bioinformatics and NLP too. And to top it all of Computer Vision. I assume the by-pixel techniques used in this course were just illustrating the points, as I would expect Gabor wavelets or something to reduce dimensionality and save ourselves from sliding windows (and rotations as a bonus). I am not sure if in this specialisation I would have liked to have all ""science"" points (how to run an experiment analyse results) separate from ""how to implement an algorithm"" and ""why the algorithm works"" or mixed in as this course does. I think either works. Some navigational infrastructure on coursera would be awesome (wiki style opportunities to jump around between ""aspects"" etc.). Finally, some summary notes would be very useful. When I do decide to implement any of this I will have to look through the exercise pdfs which are a bit long and at my code - perhaps, at the end, when you know someone has completed the exercises.

My last math class was over 3 decades ago, probably before most of my classmates were born. Damn, I'm old). Even so, with Mr. Ng's teaching style, I was able to finish the course with both a good grade and - better still - a good grasp on the subject material. I will certainly continue to pursue additional learning in this area.Machine Learning is a fascinating field. I was interested in this area way back in the late 80's when I first heard the term ""Neural Network"", but there were no on-line courses in that pre-internet era, so the availability of information about the subject was very limited. It was mainly in breathless magazine articles about the coming ""AI"" revolution. It took a few decades for that promising spark to mature into a practical reality. Now, with the appearance of Coursera and other on-line education portals, much of this information is readily available to all with the curiosity and perseverance to learn about it.I am grateful for this opportunity to learn about Machine Learning!",5,"['course machine learing challenging able', 'and very rewarding', 'first line course taken', 'many years since last formal college course', 'little rusty math 55 yrs old ancient compared peers class', 'last math class 3 decades ago probably classmates born', ""damn, i'm old)"", 'even so, with mr', ""ng's teaching style able finish course"", 'good grade better still good grasp subject material', 'certainly continue pursue additional learning area', 'machine learning fascinating field', ""interested area way back late 80's"", 'first heard term neural network no', 'line courses pre internet era availability information subject limited', 'mainly breathless magazine articles coming ai revolution', 'took decades promising spark mature practical reality', 'appearance coursera line education portals much', 'information readily available curiosity perseverance learn', 'grateful opportunity learn machine learning']"

I'm writing regarding the Machine Learning course taught by Andrew Ng of Stanford.

In my own discussions afterwards, I learned that I wasn't the only one having trouble finding the errata. Apparently it's a long-standing problem which creates extra work for mentors as well as slowing down students. Would it be possible to provide the errata links, or a link to the Machine Learning Course wiki, in a dedicated section of the Course Content? This would help a lot of people.

There are several mathematical abstractions used that perhaps have a purpose in later machine learning applications but seem unnecessary here.Another issue is that the course assumes the use of Octave which is not available for Windows users apparently. It also allows the use of MatLab but the quiz questions are in Octave which means the quiz is not necessarily testing understanding of the course material as it is Octave.Generally, the opportunities for feedback to Coursera are highly limited. A colleague once took a course online (through another platform). Some of the course material was objectively wrong. However, there was no ability to submit feedback.

machine-learning,7031,"My CS friend recommended me to take this course to learn more about how to use data in business, after he heard that I wanted to program an app for food. he warned me about the great deal of math involved (mainly linear algebra). me being a physics/engineering major I naturally got even more excited (it turned out that he was right, and it would also be a huge plus to know multivariate calculus, and I can see myself struggle with the concepts had I not studied both these topics to bits in school). incidentally, this was my first online coursera experience. I can tell you it will be life changing experience. No longer do I have to physically travel somewhere to listen to lectures or hand in assignments, nor download lecture notes off of the school server. This is a 24/7 always on always available service, with the best TA's to answer your questions if you get stuck on homework assignments and quizzes. Everything in the coding assignments tests your knowledge of the course lectures and is designed such that you can complete it in the shortest possible amount of time while reaping the maximum amount of benefit. It is ""easy"" sense does not require you to grind through mundane things like looking for your own training set data or writing code to plot and visualise the data, but it is ""hard"" in the sense that very often it takes an hour (or more) of studying the lectures and thinking to figure out how to solve the problem in the most efficient way as possible which often involves writing a single line of vectored matlab/octave code. It is more of an overview of the most important topics in machine learning, but will be a great springboard to go in depth into each aspect of it. Lastly, Andrew often offers wonderful insights into the day to day of machine learning professionals in his lecture videos, so I would advise watching every single minute of them to get the most out of the course instead of aiming to race over the finish line (which can be tempting at times when the deadline approaches)",5,"['cs friend recommended take course learn', 'use data business heard wanted program app food', 'warned great deal math involved mainly linear algebra', 'physics engineering major naturally got even', 'excited turned right would also huge plus', 'know multivariate calculus see struggle concepts not studied topics bits school', 'incidentally first online coursera experience', 'tell life changing experience', 'no longer physically travel somewhere listen', 'lectures hand assignments nor download lecture notes school server', '24 7 always always available service', ""best ta's answer questions get stuck homework assignments quizzes"", 'everything coding assignments tests knowledge course lectures', 'designed complete shortest possible amount time reaping maximum amount benefit', 'easy sense not require grind mundane things like looking', 'training set data writing code plot', 'visualise data hard sense often takes', 'hour studying lectures thinking figure solve', 'problem efficient way possible often involves writing', 'single line vectored matlab octave code', 'overview important topics machine learning great springboard go depth aspect', 'lastly andrew often offers wonderful insights', 'day day machine learning professionals lecture videos', 'would advise watching every single minute', 'get course instead aiming race finish line tempting times deadline approaches']"

Prof Andrew tries not to get into the advanced mathematical concepts but instead provides good intuition and then shows one how to apply the different ideas underpinning machine learning with some practical examples. In my view, this is an excellent way to quickly become familiar the concepts and to see machine learning in action. A student of the course will gain very good insights and can then follow up with the underlying math as needed.The final two lectures on how to scale machine learning to large systems and a suggested systematic framework for figuring out which aspects of the design to focus on were very instructive.In summary, i would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in the area of machine learning.

This course's USP is the in-detail theoretical treatment of the machine learning algorithms with a focus on quick prototyping using a simple language such as Octave.

R and Python might have great ML libraries, but if you wish to get your hands dirty with the engineering behind those algorithms, the build, that is - then Octave is great!.

Perhaps partial credit would be good instead of 0/20 with one wrong selection. Feedback, perhaps an explanation, would be appropriate on all questions incorrectly answered.I would also suggest a pdf document that showed how to do the various matrix operations in octave with an example or two. This would include basic and advanced operations.

I would have liked to have known the answers to some of the questions in the quizzes that I got wrong.What I loved about this course: Learning how powerful vectorization is, it allows us to write several lines of code in one single line and can be much faster than using for-loops. I was wowed several times.Prof. Andrew Ng is a great teacher. He is also extremely humble and very encouraging. During the course he often said, ""It's ok if you don't understand this completely now. It also took me time to figure this out."" This helped me a lot. He also said, ""if you got through the assignments, you should consider yourself an expert!"" and I laughed silly. By no means do I feel like an expert but now I have a basic understanding of the different types of learning algorithms, what they could be used for and more importantly this course has generated a spark in me to use this tool for things that I find interesting and for that I am very grateful. I don't think a teacher has ever thanked me for assisting a class. This is a first-time! So thank you Prof. Andrew Ng and everyone who worked to put this course together.

To have my own timeplan also helps but I even finished quite early as it was so fun.About the course contend: Andrew Ng prepared great lessons, all was pretty well explained (even when he cannot use some ""advanced math"" not to lose part of the students). The examples were illustrative as well as realistic (at least seemed realistic and that makes it more exciting than some artificial ones).I was little afraid of the programming exercises as I've never worked with Matlab (using mainly R). But now I'm glad that I know another language:) The system of submitting works perfectly.I can say similar thinks about the contend of the exercises as I wrote about examples in lectures. It is nice to program my own spam filter - the concept of programming only some small parts of the program and not to have to deal with data loading, plotting... is again very entertaining and instructive and then it can be done some nice application in short time.My thanks to the whole Coursera team and of course Andrew Ng.

machine-learning,8999,"The Good: This course is a good introduction to fundamental topics and basic techniques in machine learning. I feel that the biggest strength of this course comes from Prof. Ng's suggestions for how to design and improve machine learning systems in practice.The Bad: This course is a few years old, and there are a lot of errors in the videos and even occasionally in the programming exercises as well. In my opinion, there is a little too much hand-holding in the programming exercises, so that while I was able to implement the important bits and pieces of the algorithms, I didn't get much chance to practice the more difficult task of organizing the entire system.The Ambiguous: This course is *very* light on the math, perhaps as light as you could possibly get. I imagine this is a relief for a lot of people, but personally I felt annoyed and even a little patronized with the number of times Prof. Ng said that we ""don't have to worry"" about the mathematical details of different concepts and algorithms. It's fine to skip over derivations and details for the sake of a simple presentation or to emphasize practical application, but surely it is important to go back and see what all this stuff means eventually. I will certainly be looking for other courses on machine learning that give a more mathematical treatment, and I think that anyone who wants to seriously get into ML should probably do the same. On a related note, Prof. Ng takes his time in each video, speaking slowly, repeating different points, and carefully explicating formulas with examples. For some people that may be good, but I found myself frequently skipping ahead in videos because I just wanted to get to the point.",4,"['good course good introduction fundamental topics basic techniques machine learning', 'feel biggest strength course comes prof', ""ng's suggestions design improve machine learning systems practice"", 'bad course years old lot errors', 'videos even occasionally programming exercises well', 'opinion little much hand holding programming exercises', 'able implement important bits pieces algorithms', ""didn't get much chance practice difficult task organizing entire system"", 'ambiguous course light math perhaps light could possibly get', 'imagine relief lot people personally felt annoyed', 'even little patronized number times prof', ""ng said don't worry mathematical details different concepts algorithms"", 'fine skip derivations details sake simple presentation', 'emphasize practical application surely important go back see stuff means eventually', 'certainly looking courses machine learning give', 'mathematical treatment think anyone wants seriously get ml probably', 'related note prof', 'ng takes time video speaking slowly repeating different points carefully explicating formulas examples', 'people may good found frequently skipping ahead videos wanted get point']"

practical-machine-learning,9288,"Thank you for inviting me to be a beta tester for Practical Machine Learning. I completed this course at the beginning of October of this year. When I was asked to be a ""beta tester"" I thought that I would be presented with new materials. However, the only thing that has changed is the look and layout of the Coursera web pages. The video lectures, quizzes, and assignment are the same as they have been for quite some time. Here are some specific comments:1. The video lectures: To me, these are clear and easy to follow. However, like those in the other courses in the Data Science Specialization, this course covers a wide range of subjects but tends not to have much depth. When I compare this and other courses in the specialization to other moocs that I have taken including Machine Learning with Andrew Ng and the Stanford Online EdX Course Statistical Learning with Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani, the somewhat cursory treatment of the topics in the Data Science Specialization becomes more noticeable. Perhaps in the interest of ""truth in advertising"" this course should be called ""A Brief Introduction to Practical Machine Learning."" In the interest of full disclosure, I should note that I have an undergraduate degree in economics and an MS and PhD in psychology with a quantitative bent. I have had lots of statistics courses, especially those related to ANOVA, MANOVA, nonparametric statistics, correlation and regression methods, and structural equation modeling. The latter is important in psychology because researchers in this field like to measure latent variables. I had been an analyst using SPSS for several decades and the courses in this specialization helped me to migrate to R. Also, there have been may new developments that have become more accessible through R packages (like the fancier tree methods) that were not available when I completed my PhD. Thus these courses (and others such as the ones by Ng and Hastie and Tibshirani) have helped me to keep abreast of these developments. So they are good for me, but I wonder to what degree do the courses in the Data Science Specialization actually make a person a ""data scientist?""2. The quizzes: I think these items are good practice and are at a reasonable level of difficulty. However, these items are the same ones that you have been giving for quite some time, with perhaps a few new ones added. A little googling will lead you to the answers to these quizzes posted online. I recommend that you put a little time and effort into writing all new items.3. The final project: Again, this project is good practice and seems to be at a reasonable level of difficulty. And again, this is the same project that appears to have been given at the end of numerous iterations of this course. And again, numerous write-ups for this project can be found online. And again, I would recommend that you put a little time and effort into finding a new data set for people to analyze. This would help minimize some of the rampant cheating that I found in this and in other classes in the specialization.On the subject of cheating, when I was doing the peer grading for the courses in the Specialization, I would enter the code of the students that I was grading into the Google search box and all too often I found links to submissions for the project by students who had taken earlier sessions of the class. That is, students were copying these earlier submissions by other students and submitting them as their own. And I don't mean that they were similar: students were copying other people's work line by line, character by character. I found that to be quite irritating and I always reported it to Coursera. Of course, if the instructors would change their assignments once I a while, then this sort of copying would be impossible. As it is, it appears that the good professors put a lot of time and effort into creating what are indeed a worthwhile set of classes. However, after they created the classes, they seem to have pushed the ""autopilot"" button and gone off to do their day jobs. I would suggest that re-engaging with these courses and reading some of the comments that other students have made would be helpful.Overall, I appreciate the courses in the Data Science Specialization and specifically this course.

real-life-data-science,9348,"The course tests are at times partially unrelated to the content of the lessons. In the test of Lesson 7 we are asked if removing jargon from an analysis makes the analysis clearer. This is never mentioned in the course.The question does not have a unique yes/no solution. It depends on the context, in particular on the audience of the analysis and report. If I'm talking to technical people who knows a lot about the topic jargon can be useful, on the other hand if jargon is not documented it can be confusing.How are we supposed to know this?This is just one example, but all the courses of the EDS specialisation had these issues. I don't know if it is a language barrier or what but I feel that I didn't have a chance to study more to get a better score.

But for this one, I'm giving 3 stars, not because the content is not good (it is; it provides good practical and experiential information), but rather because the material seems repetitive at times either within the same course or with topics in the other courses. Also, the sequencing and lectures seem sometime a bit disjointed.May I humbly suggest an idea: Integrate the key points of this course relating to real-world examples and the sharing of real-world experiences into one of the other courses.Thank you.Robert Al-Jaar, PhDrobert.aljaar@rassociates.biz",3,"['brian jeff roger thank much data science courses really great', 'generally rate 5 stars', 'one giving 3 stars not content', 'not good provides good practical experiential information', 'rather material seems repetitive times either within course topics courses', 'also sequencing lectures seem sometime bit disjointed', 'may humbly suggest idea integrate key points', 'course relating real world examples sharing real world experiences one courses', 'thank you', 'robert al jaar phdrobert', 'aljaar@rassociates', 'biz']"

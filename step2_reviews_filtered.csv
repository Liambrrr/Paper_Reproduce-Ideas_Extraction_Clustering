big-data-machine-learning,good,4
big-data-machine-learning,Perfect overview on machine learning methods. The numerical example could be better. The Neural Network is also didn't cover that is very common now.,4
big-data-machine-learning,This course is a great fit between theory and pratice,5
big-data-machine-learning,"Really fun, glad I finally finished. I got so distracted running off and learning things. I got familiar with scala and python along the way too.",5
big-data-machine-learning,"This is the best course of this specialization. Dr. Nguyen describes and teaches the contents of machine learning with clarity and digested knowledge.I would suggest to add more in-depth contents to each of the machine learning category, especially clustering, classification and association, at least as optional contents in case the number of weeks allocated for course are restricted.",5
big-data-machine-learning,Very good,5
big-data-machine-learning,Very interesting cource! Thank you!I would suggest to advance python tasks,5
big-data-machine-learning,"Nice course, very practical.",5
big-data-machine-learning,"This course introduces the basic concepts of ML beautifully, the instructor explains everything in a very lucid way. It also teaches modeling with ML in KNIME. I would personally want to know more about spark, but this course gives a good introduction. Overall very good starting point for beginners.",5
big-data-machine-learning,Very basic things... Any examples for regression.,3
big-data-machine-learning,Very well explained course on Machine Learning. I am grateful for the highly insightful course like this. I will recommend this course for all data enthusiasts.,5
big-data-machine-learning,not enough work in the other machine learning models (the course centered the main part of it to classification ),4
big-data-machine-learning,"I think its a good introductory course, but lacking in exercises.",4
big-data-machine-learning,-,4
big-data-machine-learning,"This is a valuable course in learning the basics of machine learning. but I was hoping to to get more hands on practice in this course. but overall, i learned a lot with the existing content.",4
big-data-machine-learning,"well structured, fits well to beginners!",4
big-data-machine-learning,"Good overview of tools specially Spark. The last demo handson with Spark clustering had too much content to be covered in 11 minutes. The presenter does not give any details on many functions he was using. Felt like copy paste coding. The rest was good, specially the lecturer compared to the lecturers of the other courses of the specialisation.",4
big-data-machine-learning,It is really great.,5
big-data-machine-learning,The course was the best introduction I had for machine learning. Helped me a lot to understand different concepts from people who already know about the subject and I didn't have any idea.,5
big-data-machine-learning,Easy to follow. Good resource to understand the basic concept of big data.,4
big-data-machine-learning,"I really enjoyed the course since it's match with my patience and work, in addition I'd like to highlight the instructor, clear,organized idea and steps, this was 70% of the success of the course I believe.",5
big-data-machine-learning,It's ok for an extremely high-level overiew,3
big-data-machine-learning,Excelent Introductory course to MACHINE LEARNING with Big Data.,5
big-data-machine-learning,Great introduction with great tools. Has definitely inspired me to lean more about 'Machine Learning'!,5
big-data-machine-learning,excellent! best place to begin with Big Data and ML!,4
big-data-machine-learning,"The course helped me understand the concepts of the machine learning from the very rudimentary level. It also laid the foundation for understanding and dealing with the practical implementation of the machine learning algorithms and their implementation in big data which eventually elevated my understanding of applications dealing machine learning with Big Data.Thanks to all the mentors and instructors for everything- the teaching materials, quizzes, assignments and hands-on; everything was awesome.",5
big-data-machine-learning,thanks so much,5
big-data-machine-learning,the course helped understand the machine learning concepts and the hands-on were very comprehensive.,5
big-data-machine-learning,"The course content is very poorly explained. The quiz questions don't really test what was taught in the lectures, and the assignments are just copying and pasting things. I feel like I still have a very poor understanding of what was supposedly covered in the course. I cannot generalise or apply the 'learned' information or skills to other topics or researches because I didn't actually understand the core concepts or how to use the programs.",1
big-data-machine-learning,"Both the professors are great , the videos helped alot in understanding lot of core concepts in machine learning.",5
big-data-machine-learning,"This was a good introductory class to machine learning, but I wish it had more depth.",4
big-data-machine-learning,"Machine learning is too simplified and spark part is not even explained, also very little relation of all course with Big Data.",2
big-data-machine-learning,excellent!!,5
big-data-machine-learning,"Have to make sure that code provided are fine and without problem... also, better instructions on how to go about the tool needed to use. Remember, we are learning and the amount of tools in Big Data ecosystem is vast...",4
big-data-machine-learning,Good overview of working with SPARK and KNIME - acceptable little theoretical background for all the presented concepts for the sake of application use.,4
big-data-machine-learning,"This is another course in UCSD's ""Big Data"" introductory course. The material is not pertinent to a specialty on big data technologies. Further the course does not increase one's knowledge of Machine Learning in any way that justifies spending the time in the course.",1
big-data-machine-learning,Almost a useless course - ML overview using KNIME which gives no insight whatsoever.,2
big-data-machine-learning,insightful,4
build-data-science-team,Excellent!,5
build-data-science-team,"This class was a great introduction to the topic of building a data science team.The material was practically oriented, cited a lot of relevant external sources (e.g., news articles about data science), and was easy to understand.The production quality was excellent - easy to listen to, ready to follow the slides, and the questions immediately followed each short segment.I would have preferred it if the Professor had gone through different examples of data scientist and data engineering resumes to show me what performers in each quintile look like and what signals distinguish members of each quintile from the higher or lower quintile. Apart from the signals, and interview questions used to elicit these signals, how would the ability levels be different.",5
build-data-science-team,This course was very helpful! Thank you.,5
build-data-science-team,Excellent,5
build-data-science-team,"It was a bit.... general. That could be a bias of mine, as I have done quite a bit of management-type work, so maybe it didn't feel that new or informative.",3
build-data-science-team,"Some of the multiple choice questions are _really_ more opinion than fact - making it almost impossible to get them ""right""",4
build-data-science-team,Really enjoyed myself,5
build-data-science-team,Good introduction to managing a team from the perspective of Data Science.,5
build-data-science-team,"Good overview for those without management experience. For experienced folks -- probably a good number since this is an Executive Data Science course -- it was pretty basic. Also some of the elements come down to management style. For some, other approaches have worked well and might not be ready to switch philosophies based on the course.Otherwise, pretty good.",3
build-data-science-team,"Very good overview , very interesting and with a very good management approach.",5
build-data-science-team,"As usual the team does a great job of distilling complex ideas without sacrificing the quality of information. Data Science is a complicated field. Don't be fooled by the topics, the walk before you run approach is super productive for your learning curve if you're not native to this field.",5
build-data-science-team,"A nice course, and very helpful!",5
build-data-science-team,"very good course for beginners, in my case I built the same team and processes by heart and it matched the suggestions in this course",5
build-data-science-team,"Extremely practical and essentially human, this was really interesting to better understand the different roles and how to help data science teams to work together, highly recommended",5
build-data-science-team,"This seemed more appropriate for a startup, and most of the content was rudimentary",1
build-data-science-team,This course was much better than the previous one in the series.,4
build-data-science-team,Great class!,5
build-data-science-team,Must do it! Really good!,5
build-data-science-team,Very helpful and easy learning and objec,5
build-data-science-team,A very interesting course focus on the true life with data science teams. This course is more about the day to day life and problem to manage a data science team and less about pure organization. The financial aspects are not covered by Jeff nor the complex problems of people organization. I have noticed that I was the sole person to post on the forum.,4
build-data-science-team,A quick and Great introduction on building effective Teams,5
build-data-science-team,Nice course. Thank you.,5
build-data-science-team,"Jeff Leek is great, explains things in a very clear and understandable way. Loved the course.",5
build-data-science-team,Very well documented and presented. I thoroughly enjoyed the course.,5
build-data-science-team,Great knowledge,5
build-data-science-team,"Good overview of the roles and skills needed, but loses a little momentum when it gets into the team management side of things, which is covered in many other business courses.",4
build-data-science-team,"Great course, learned lots about building and leading a data science team; and also some tips on keeping teams motivated and ensuing communication and collaboration works well.",5
build-data-science-team,Excellent lecturer and the topic focuses on issues specific to data science teams rather than general business practice.,5
build-data-science-team,Good overview of forming Data science team. The challenges are typical of any SDLC project. However I was looking to glean some specific challenges between DSc team and product or marketing teams.,4
build-data-science-team,"Very useful for learners who do not have a background in Data Science or, Software engineering",4
build-data-science-team,"Very good course! Thanks to it, i got an interest in developing my skills in Data Analysis further.",5
build-data-science-team,"Content was good and questions were well-thought. Video lectures however would need written notes to accompany them. Also when videos are as long and fast-paced as it is in the course it would be nice to throw the major point in discussion on the background,this would help clarify and focus the idea the lecturer is trying to convey.",3
build-data-science-team,For those non technical coming to the subje,5
build-data-science-team,Easy to understand and very valuable,4
build-data-science-team,"Good pointers but not a lot of unique new insights. A lot of this is based on building any team, not unique to Data Science",4
build-data-science-team,"Short, well organized, and very useful. Perhaps quizzes could be improved in order to address more relevant topics. Thanks!",4
build-data-science-team,"Great overview, lots of useful tips, and an interesting angle to approach data science that i was not well versed in.",5
build-data-science-team,"needed more depth, which still could have been achieved in a 1-week format",3
build-data-science-team,G,5
build-data-science-team,"If you know anything about management, specifically software engineering management, this course won't tell you anything new. It's very high level survey of best practices. I'm currently working as a software engineer on data science problems alone on my team. I wanted some idea of how data science teams are typically structured for when I need to talk about my work to my chain of command and my peers and for interacting with other dedicated data science teams at my company. I feel I got a pretty good idea of that and a better understanding the roles in an ideal team. I also feel prepared for the future if I were to apply for a role on a dedicated data science team. As far as actually building a team myself, I think this course won't really give you that if you don't already have other management experience, but it does give you some insight on the specifics of data science people. Finally, Quizzes could use some review, the answers don't often line up grammatically with the questions. Also the one with the instructor's LinkedIn profile linked doesn't work because LinkedIn covers the content and wants you to create an account. A link to a resume or something might be better.",3
build-data-science-team,Excellent Certification course on Team and deliverable management related to Data Science.,4
build-data-science-team,Very basic,2
build-data-science-team,Material presented was succinct and easily understandable.,4
build-data-science-team,Very informative course on building a data science team!,5
build-data-science-team,"I will be using in my project,It is really important to articulate the various areas of my organization with the data censors, can work transversally",5
build-data-science-team,very informative with practical inputs.,5
build-data-science-team,"Some of the videos are very basic concepts on how to lead a team (i.e.: Management strategies, common difficulties,...). It is already known things for a manager with some experience leading teams. This course could be shorter.",3
build-data-science-team,great course and instructor!,5
build-data-science-team,Great useful course,5
build-data-science-team,"For most people this might be four stars. There is solid content here, but I couldn't help but feel a lot of this stuff is fairly standard OD/management material and in some ways, it felt like asking, say, a project manager to deliver a data science course. If you have never done any managerial training or read material on intrinsic motivation, org and team culture, then you will get value. For me this was pretty stock",3
build-data-science-team,The mode of teaching was interesting and I hope you can do better in the area of providing answers to questions we missed after the course. Thanks for the opportunity given to me.,5
build-data-science-team,"The explanation of roles is clear. So are other remarkt / piffalls / do's and don'ts. But those are valid for all specialist functionsCouple of remarks:(1) The target audience seems to be the data manager, rather than any executive (C/ C-1 level) of function (HR) dealing with building a data science team.(2) With regard to management and organizing, I missed the ""academic"" level (organisational design) nor did it help in setting up data science (where / how to start ?).",2
build-data-science-team,"Hi everyone !It is my honor to appreciate what I learnt from this course. I love it,the university,and the instructors. It is a step forward for my carrier.",5
build-data-science-team,I'm not sure if the material presented in this course warranted a whole separate course (even if it only was one week). It probably could have been inserted in various segments of a larger data science specialization throughout the classes. Most of the topics discussed should be common knowledge to a mid-level manager of data science or even strategic marketing in general.,2
build-data-science-team,Rudimentary HR / new supervisor level information. Not specific to Data Science either.,1
build-data-science-team,Really well put together material and the Jeff Leek is engaging as a lecturer,5
build-data-science-team,"This material is important, but the assessment quizzes were tedious as the right answer often hung on some small obscure remark that was hard to recall.",2
build-data-science-team,Great course for someone who will be leading a DS team for the first time.,5
build-data-science-team,"Really great course, quick yet informative!",5
build-data-science-team,too pricy,4
build-data-science-team,This course delivered all the materials the way I expected it to and was easy to understand.,5
build-data-science-team,"A good, enjoyable course with some interesting additional reading. I think I would have preferred a little more detail/content to have given it a full five stars. That said...I am very happy to have taken and passed the course. Thank you all involved. Now on to 'Managing Data Analysis'!!",4
build-data-science-team,Good and useful material,5
build-data-science-team,This course gave me good insight about building a data science team that can be easily related to my work environment.,4
build-data-science-team,"My name is Jose Antonio from Brazil. I am looking for a new Data Scientist career.Please, take a look at my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseantonio11I did this course to get new knowledge about Big Data and better understand the technology and your practical applications.The course was excellent and the classes well taught by teachers.Congratulations to Coursera team and Instructors.Regards",5
build-data-science-team,There could be more work in the assignments in this course. The Quizzes are very simple.,3
build-data-science-team,Thanks,5
build-data-science-team,"I will like a little more of excersices, ""real""/""simulate"" problems.",4
build-data-science-team,Great course!,5
build-data-science-team,Lectures are very brief and concepts that were delivered will surely help Data Science Managers intheir profession.,5
build-data-science-team,In my opinion this course does not fit to the specialization well. Not sure how big proportion of the specialization students have a background different from data science and are going to manage the data science team.,2
build-data-science-team,Very clearly presented!,5
build-data-science-team,Good course,5
build-data-science-team,Excellent overview of the structure and dynamics of data science teams in various types of organizations.,5
build-data-science-team,good insights and ways to avoid problems in building and importantly advertising your team,4
build-data-science-team,Very short. Quality of the course is OK.,3
build-data-science-team,Very challenging and practical,5
build-data-science-team,It does what it says,5
build-data-science-team,"This is a great course and a daring venture for what is really an art form, beyond it's scientific requirements. This part of the specialization needs a little refinement.I posted this in the discussion forum.· 7 days ago · EditedFirst of all.....these guys running this data science department have their hands full. They are teaching live classes for students who have spent OODLES (lots) of money to attend this prestigious college . Johns Hopkins is about as good as it gets for a medical degree. Then they are doing experiments and other data science for the research division of Johns Hopkins which is also as good as it gets........THEN they are doing these MOOC courses on top of all their other responsibilities......Dr. Leek is a University of Washington Alumni, which is also top notch for Data Science.The video lesson is flawed, there is no denying it. But I must say these teachers are very open to improvement in the course and your comments on what could be better done are received and acted upon, so I would include them in your thank you letter to the teachers.ALSO I think these MOOC courses are best done by all members of the department contributing. Truly this field IS a team sport. I feel this course was good, but the videos need to be edited and scripted, so unnecessary language, which dilutes the core knowledge, that must be learned, is not diluted where questions are left in the students head about content when being tested. I learned long ago in a college calculus class that if your mark isn't perfect, it's OK, so long as you pass with a high score......even if it is the teachers fault. The course could use better video production with teleprompter scripting......maybe some AV students at Johns Hopkins could get on board. it will happen eventually I'm sure.You want to take a course that is absolutely one of the best courses I've taken anywhere and truly the best online. Try the number one business course on Coursera:GROW TO GREATNESS, either part 1 or 2, University of Virginia, Darden School Of Business...........A team created course with one helluva a teacher who is a business person, researcher and award-winning writer. I would recommend this course to ANY student and especially E-Teachers.The problem with this course is that there is a lot of information that can be included but may not be absolutely necessary as a ""core concept"". Needless to say, the more technical skills any employee has, the more insight they will have into their teammate's skills, as well, as the overall mission of the data department and the business it serves. I'm more of a tech and infrastructure person, I'm not real passionate about coding. I find it tedious. The more I learn about it, the more I enjoy it, albeit, from a distance. I can't see myself creating great blocks of scripts, but the more I know about how they are created AND what rules the code in a project must abide by, the better my skills will be as a data center manager. So I'm trying to learn as much as possible about R, Python, and companion programs like ggvis for creating visualizations. I'd say visualizations are an essential skill for a data manager, since you have to present results and projects, questions, and answers to higher ups and other departments.this link comes from the resource section of this course:https://www.datacamp.com/courses/ggvis-data-visualization-r-tutorialThis link or URL is of much more value to me, than a flawed test question and a reduction in my 100 percent average in the specialization.Without this lesson, in this course, I would not have this valuable resource.Another great link, which has a great FREE print publication as well:http://www.processor.com/ ...these people have been advising data center managers longer than just about anybody !Verbally and in the transcript are some nebulous statements that point toward the main idea, that concept being: the more any employee, on any data science or technical team member IS, a ""jack of all trades"", the better. So that could have been included in some more general way on the quiz, because really that is pretty much a general rule, I've found, working in ANY capacity in the tech industry. I have done a great deal of audio editing, working at numerous radio stations, with Adobe Audition. With others like: Pro Tools, or any other really good quality AV digital editor the result is streamlined, near seamless, audio-video, or one or the other. You just learn how to read and edit wave forms of all kinds.Years ago, in Dallas, Texas, attending Richland College. I learned a valuable lesson. I was taking a college level Calc-Trig math class being taught by the regular professor's WIFE. I don't know if the professor was sick, but this woman, who was teaching the class for the whole semester, frankly, was not qualified. I had always been considered an illiterate by my high school math teachers, a married couple who, frankly, were highly abnormal even on the geekiest scale. These people were acting like they were a world above most people in the class. Needless to say, I assumed, by their ""adult"" opinions, they were sent by God Himself, to educate me thru denigration.I was amazed, how 10 years later, in College math how well I was doing. I was carrying a 100 percent average ! So midterm this faux professor declares, ""I'll be prefiguring all the arithmetic to be easy, so you won't have to bring your calculators !""SO I DIDN'T.......and of course the teacher's wife proclaims.....""I didn't have time to make the arithmetic easy so you'd better use your calculators !"" I literally had pages and pages of figuring in handwriting accompanying my 3 page test. The result was a C plus on the test. I angrily told the sub teacher ""I did not bring a calculator to this test because you said it wouldn't be necessary, therefore I must be allowed to redo this test with a calculator !"" She of course relented, ""No that won't be possible...that's not a bad grade...."" she continued, ""what are you worried about ?""........I was so peeved, I was going to drop the class. It was too late in the semester, and I was so disgusted with this woman's cavalier dismissal of my perfect grade that I just stopped going to class. The result was a failing final grade.Who ultimately suffered from this dilemma ? That, albeit, unfairly was me.....who created this ""academic"" tragedy, by the aggravation of a deeply flawed situation. Once again, that would be me.",4
build-data-science-team,"The information is useful, but I think the five courses in the specialization could be merged into a single one.",3
build-data-science-team,"This was a fine overview however I was hoping to drill down into more detail on some of the roles and responsibilites data teams can have. For example data architects, stewards etc.",3
build-data-science-team,Good course to build a foundation on how to recruit your data science team,5
build-data-science-team,"Well organized body of knowledge on how to build efficient data science team, from 0 to 60. Addresses a number of challenges including how to build an inter-disciplinary team, what to expect from practitioners from different disciplines, how to recognize right candidates, how to assign the right mix of practitioners to right business problems, how to cross-polinate the knowledge, how to keep feedback loops at professional level as it's fraught with potential for conflicting opinions, when to stop analysis, how to empower the team to initiate next iterations with business, common pitfalls and more. Worth every $ and all the time you'll spend on it.",5
build-data-science-team,"great for existence human and android based life-form simulation internal lifestyle...The course improves life within the simulation 10 fold at least(when combined with the other specialization courses) ...Perfect learning tool for those who have worked professionally in research field sin our simulation and yet now have a touch of ""the turrings"" or you know : CBI...Special thanks to the designers of the course.Top scores for coursera.org &John Hopkins ...",5
build-data-science-team,"Good but should come after the Managing Data Analysis for understanding better what the people you hire are actually going to do. Preventing the ""Dilbertification"" of the data science manager.",4

build-data-science-team,Excellent Course and Series!,5
build-data-science-team,Very informative,5
build-data-science-team,I have studied this course as part of the Executive Data Science Specialization. I think this set of four courses meet my objectives by providing a very nice overview on the key points of data science projects. They are good to give a flavor on data science and data science projects helping decide if you want to search for more in depth knowledge.,4
build-data-science-team,A very helpful course in understanding how the team composition should be and the typical Job descriptions of different members of the team.,5
build-data-science-team,Easy to understanding the structure knowledge of building a data science team.,5
build-data-science-team,High level but with enough details and context to make sense of the manager/exec/director's role in data science or the enterprise employing data science.,5

build-data-science-team,"The courses in the specialization are - in my opinion, excessively short.",3
build-data-science-team,"I really enjoyed this course and I have found a lot of similarities with issues and challenges that I face every day at work. This has been very useful to me bot as a way to get inspired on new ideas and techniques, and as a way to confirm what I am already doing.However, there were few occasions where I found the quizzes not to be clear enough.In some instances this was due to the fact that the question asked required some extra knowledge that couldn't possibly be achieved only by reading the course material or listening to the class. I was lucky I new the answers because of my personal experience but it seemed quite unfair in my opinion. Also lectures materials are very short and don;t provide any extra information.In other cases, the answers, especially when there were multiple answers didn't seem to be clear enough and sometimes contradicting what I had listened in the class. I don't remember specific cases at the moment, however I have left feedbacks throughout the course. You should have my feedbacks where I mentioned specific questions that in my opinion were confusing.Hope this helps,Giacomo",4

build-data-science-team,Very Informative & Elaborate,5
build-data-science-team,Good coverage in a very fast intro to the subject. Definitely take away some things I am able to put into use in my work. I get the feeling this is quite a new course (compared with the very well established Data Science Specialization) and does not have the student interaction base yet. I hope this aspect develops - perhaps even with the TAs. For this level course student interaction could be even more valuable than the more hands on data science subjects. Hope this specialization takes off as well as the DSS did!,4
build-data-science-team,Great idea and syllabus.The videos are too short and missing some explanations.,3
build-data-science-team,Great Course,5
build-data-science-team,"This is a great course for helping you decide where you fit in the data science domain. The content is very clear, informative and have definite suggestions and conclusions. Unlike most of the information available on this topic, which mostly says that you need to be a unicorn to be in this space, this course talks sense, divides scope, suggests achievable targets and you can plan and assess rationally.Also Jeff is a classic teacher,it's always rewarding to listen to him whatever be the topic.",5

data-science-course,A very good introduction to Data Science!!,4
data-science-course,"Very basic course, gives a bird view of the Data Science",5
data-science-course,"Executive Summary: Do not spend time on this course if you have minimal common sense and have read at least one article on Data Science.I finished the 11 week course ""Machine Learning - Stanford University - by Andrew Ng"" 2 months ago, which was such a great course! It kept me busy for about 20 days (at about 4-6 hours per day) and I learned so much!This course ""A Crash Course in Data Science - Johns Hopkins University"" , Part of a 5-course series, the Executive Data Science Specialization, provided just some superficial obvious information, took me only 3 hours to complete and even this time I would could wasted time.Finally coursera now starts to make courses smaller and smaller and them adding multiple of them up to ""Specialization"", so that at the end you have to pay much more to get a certain amount of information and course time. With this course they seem to have streched it to a new extreme. The price for the certificate for this superficial short mini course has reached the same price ($ 44) as what I payed for the extensive great Machine Learning course from Stanford University by Andrew Ng !",1
data-science-course,Quick and fairly easy course to complete. Gives you good and short insight into what data science is all about.,5
data-science-course,Good for getting a quick summary of what Data Science is for those new to the field.,4
data-science-course,"Really should be retitled to ""An Executive Overview of Data Science."" The course covered all the critical Data Science components that Executives or Senior Management should be aware of. Corporate america still does not understand, nor recognize the critical components of properly funding, supporting and committing to a Data Science effort or program. This course outlines the needed core components for a successful Data Science journey that could impact the top and bottom line.",5
data-science-course,Great for beginners in Data Science. Lecturer are good and instructors are very knowledgeable and provided valuable inputs through short duration lectures.,5
data-science-course,too general,1
data-science-course,Fast and objective. Great course.,5

data-science-course,Great to have an idea about what Data Science means,5
data-science-course,Indeed a crash course. Gives an excellent overview of key concepts in Data Science and whets your appetite for more,5
data-science-course,"This course is the 2nd certificate course I've completed through Johns Hopkins and Coursera, and the content is always excellent. I suggest pausing the videos and take notes to grasp everything, and for reference if you're going to take other courses along this path. I am also going to complete the other Data Science certification offered by JHU",5
data-science-course,"Good crash course. Not really sure if a certificate is really needed here though, since it's basically an overview/introduction in data science.",5
data-science-course,A very nice introduction to Data Science. Loved it!!!,5
data-science-course,"It would be good to be able to complete the quizzes even if you are not paying for the certificate, this would enable people to understand how much they have taken away from the class.",4
data-science-course,I was quite satisfied with the content of this course.,4
data-science-course,Great crash course! Wide variety of information and useful for me as I lead a data science team.,5
data-science-course,"Really organised, simple, the teachers are awesome.",5
data-science-course,Great beginning to Data Science,4
data-science-course,"Good intent but poor execution. Tries to summarize all the major topics but ends up delivering a totally disjointed, cut-and-paste experience with no real flow.",2
data-science-course,Good overview,4
data-science-course,Great course! thank you very much this was very insightfull!,5
data-science-course,Great! Very interesting & informative.,4
data-science-course,It is a good introductory course in Data Science,4
data-science-course,"I recommend this course to all who wish to be a data scientist, and, for those who want to be managers of a team of data scientists. The course introduces basic concepts, tips and tools, and also good articles as supplementary reading. Recommended!",5
data-science-course,Excellent intro into what Data Science and Data Science projects really are.,5
data-science-course,Highly recommended - efficient way to crash into Data Science.,5
data-science-course,A little devoid of depth.,1
data-science-course,Good introductory course for Data Science,4
data-science-course,Great Learning,4
data-science-course,Great crash course with the fundamentals of Data Science. Excellent for having some ideas about the subject.,5
data-science-course,"Very good introduction, by real experts.",5
data-science-course,Very short. Quality of the course is also not that good.,2
data-science-course,A wonderful course for getting exposed with the fundamentals of Data Science. A must for those who wish to understand what exactly the Data Science.,5
data-science-course,It was a good introduction to a subject that is polluted by big data hype. Although I am giving 5 stars I wish slides for software engineering part were also published.,5
data-science-course,Learned the basics of what goes on in data science world.,5
data-science-course,"fairly general concepts of data science, but may be quite helpful l for people totally new to the field of data (e.g. not having any idea), or as material to review the big picture of data science",4
data-science-course,I liked the methodology to explain with details all the embasement of Data Science. I'm learning since the basic to advanced. I'm gonna do a MBA in area of Data Science and this certification become a more one step to me. Congrats from Brazil.,5
data-science-course,This course was Great!,5
data-science-course,"Quite basic material... If you have some technical background you might fund this course not so useful.However, I think that it does provide the right information for non-technical managers in a simple and comprehensive way.Personally, I wish it was a bit longer and deeper to feel like I acquired more knowledge to take it to the next level independently.",4
data-science-course,Great intro,5
data-science-course,"Provided a good, very high level overview. I audited so I didn't take the quizzes, but the questions were all on the general side. I liked how they used some examples of real-life research.",4
data-science-course,Quick and concise. A great deal of knowledge acquired.,4
data-science-course,Was a good introduction. The focus was good as I feel I came away with knowledge of the field as opposed to technology. Only recommendation is to ask professors to use more practical examples in the lectures.,4
data-science-course,"Although it was the first course to which I registered (makes it hard for me to rate and compare), I really enjoyed the lectures and found the information clear and concise! Can't wait to start the following courses related to Executive Data Science.",5
data-science-course,"Was expecting more of the how to's and a bit of programming or at least concepts of the programming/statistics, but I guess there are different interpretations of the idea of a crash course.Definitely geared for people who work with data scientists but not in the data science field.",3
data-science-course,"Great overview. The distinction between statistics and machine learning gets a little fuzzy, but probably because I never took statistics, and have only used machine learning in a limited context. Really enjoyed it, thanks.",5
data-science-course,"great for existence human and android based life-form simulation internal lifestyle...The course improves life within the simulation 10 fold at least(when combined with the other specialization courses) ...Perfect learning tool for those who have worked professionally in research field sin our simulation and yet now have a touch of ""the turrings"" or you know : CBI...Special thanks to the designers of the course.Top scores for coursera.org &John Hopkins ...",5
data-science-course,Too basic.,3
data-science-course,I would have liked a bit more detail and some more examples from business perspective. But I am sure there will be a more advanced course that I could take.,4
data-science-course,Great course!,5
data-science-course,It is helpful for those who want to get an overview of what data science is all about.,4
data-science-course,Interesting but uneven. Felt like the first draft of a team-taught course,3
data-science-course,Excellent introduction. Especially liked the short lecture on supervised v. unsupervised machine learning. That answered a question I had at the outset.,5
data-science-course,"This is a great course if you need a concise background in data science. The more you explore the resources and extra materials the more you will learn. The instructors are well versed in the field and certainly have their hands full constructing software and analysis for what is quite possibly the number one research medical hospital/college in the country, Johns Hopkins. Any certificate or credentials from this institution is indeed most valuable and highly recommended. The material can be a little dense since it is a ""crash course"", but if you retake your tests and use them as a review of the basic core components of each lesson, you will get what it takes to get a team off the ground working on a real time project with precise goals and applications. Use the variable speed on the videos to slow the lectures down when needed. A great introduction to the varying data sources you will use as a data scientist.",5
data-science-course,"An outstanding short course on data science which clearly explains the what, why and how of DS.",5
data-science-course,Excellent introductory overview.,5
data-science-course,Excellent. Help me review stuff that i had learnt years ago.,5
data-science-course,Really basic course. Not needed for people you have already done data science specialization in coursera,3
data-science-course,"It's too short, I think it should be a part of a course and not a course itself.It is a repetition of concepts and examples from other courses by john hopkins univ.",1
data-science-course,Good overview course. Better for managerial folks than data engineers/scientists.,4
data-science-course,Nice content and well organised.,5
data-science-course,"Ref: ""A Crash Course in Data Science"" the content could be presented in a simpler way. Some of the presentations sounds little vague and conceptual level like an Advanced Math or, Statistics class. I am wondering since this is an Executive program, is there a simpler and easy to grasp way to present the material. The text download files (i.e. txt) document descriptions needs to be more clearer. The Power Point downloads are excellent and are to the point.",2
data-science-course,Excellent Course!,5
data-science-course,"This course is very sparse on details, and just a week of content. The lecturer is not the best at explaining concepts.",1
data-science-course,Enjoyed the structure.,4
data-science-course,"It was crisp and loaded. A perfect course for executives starting out in the field of Data Science, it, in fact, inspires one to pursue data science at a more detailed level.",5
data-science-course,The course lays out the basics of Data Science in a very easy to understand manner for someone who is a beginner and gives an overview from where you can start scouring for more information either through the further courses or outside of them.,5
data-science-course,Great teachers in this program,5
data-science-course,Excellent !!!,5
data-science-course,"Very good course, I can't wait to continue the rest of the certificate.",5
data-science-course,"Great, clear overview of the standards, principles, terms, and applications for data science - geared toward executives, managers, and professionals working with or directing colleagues and team members specializing in data science. A great snapshot for organizational leaders seeking to get a better grasp on how to make critical decisions about data science investments, resource allocations, applications, etc.",5
data-science-course,"I want to give 3.5 stars but there is only option for 3 or 4.Given that it's geared more towards wanna be managers in this field. I would have expected lot of case studies, and links to additional material for individual reading plus a mini write up or a project at the end.For MOOCs to compete with a degree program or an onsite instruction few of the things I think that are needed areInterviews with industry practitioners which is a big plus.interviews/postings from people with similar background as the 90% of the MOOC students of this program who made it... this motivates the students from dropping from the middle of the course/specilization programslinks to additional articles that the students can read at leisurewriteup/project as assignments that the students can pursue and publish (not necessarily for grade but as a mind jogger)One more thing that I think should help (not specific to this course) is that the student with the best grade should be offered one free course and think this will motivate the students to complete the courses.",3
data-science-course,I have studied this course as part of the Executive Data Science Specialization. I think this set of four courses meet my objectives by providing a very nice overview on the key points of data science projects. They are good to give a flavor on data science and data science projects helping decide if you want to search for more in depth knowledge.,4
data-science-course,Great course for somebody who does not know anything about data science. When doing this specialisation there should be credit for those that did the other data science specialisation,3
data-science-course,I finished the course in just one evening. It is really quite and easy course into various aspects of data science. The biggest benefits for me is it provides many inspirations which helps me to decide which areas of Data Science I would like to learn more later.,5
data-science-course,A really good introduction to the subject.,5
data-science-course,Lectures were fairly straightforward but not really that exciting and the lecturers sometimes felt a little unprepared or underwhelming.,3
data-science-course,"it was a great learning experience,the lectures were good and excellently designed",5
data-science-course,Really wonderful high level overview- quite helpful for me.,5
data-science-course,Great overview! Passing and internalizing are different goals - take the time to read & watch not only the mandatory items but the links to Wired etc.,5
data-science-course,Brilliant Course.,5
data-science-course,Good short introduction to the field who someone with minimal understanding of data science.,4
data-science-course,"I think the course is apt to begin getting a feel of data science management and needs. I have realised during the course that it is a fairly complex discipline for a beginner with no exposure to statistics and the terminology.Initially it might seem like over the top, but with some research and reading of suggested materials , one shall be able to get a hang of it in due time.I also believe the instructors have had to work hard to make sure the upper level course can be delivered as close as possible to the level of a beginner.My only suggestion is if they could add a list of sorts for statistical jargon , explained in layman terms, which would actually enable quicker absorbance.",5
data-science-course,"Excellent course, material and superior teaching.",5
data-science-course,"The course touches upon most important topics in Data Science but doesn't go deep into the topics:- Covers most important important topics in Data Science on high level.- Course works as a ""refresher"" to follow the course you should know the basics in statistics and modelling. Concepts like parsimonious model would be used with expectation that student already knows it.",4
data-science-course,A clear and concise training of Data science. One example of Data science project would help to understand better. Thanks.,5
data-science-course,A great primer to get you started in Data Science or get up to speed quickly.,5

data-science-course,"Very basic, for absolute beginners/ managers completely new to data (let alone data science)",1
data-science-course,Very well organized course ..Short and to the point,4
data-science-course,Solid introduction. Not so engaging if using the non-paid options,3
data-science-course,Short yet nice :),5

data-science-course,It's what I was looking for!,5
data-science-course,Great value to get started; especiall,4
data-science-course,Very helpful and interesting. Well paced.,5
data-science-course,"While to introductory, yet very good.",4
data-science-course,A satisfactory overview of the Data Science Specialization.,4
data-science-course,A really great overview of what is Data Science and how it fits in with decision making. It answered a lot of basic questions and got me curious to pursue other courses on data science. The professors were very knowledgeable and gave great examples. The only thing I would recommend to the professors is to make the lectures a little more dynamic. A voice over of static slides can be a little hard to follow.,5
data-science-course,"Good, simple, straightforward, and applied. It starts to introduce you to the language and platforms of data science, but it is most definitely not a standalone course if you want to be conversant in the field. Really just a ""taster"" to get you into the specialization.",3
data-science-course,Very good introduction to the topic and also clarifies some terms that are in the air and end up misleading. like inference prediction and machine learning.,4
data-science-course,I believe this course is much informative & provide me a clear knowledge about Data science...,5
data-science-course,I am in the middle of it.I find it a bit challenging but very interesting.,5

data-science-course,Interesting course,3
data-science-course,short and crisp,5
data-science-course,Great course about data science and terms involved in data science.,5
data-science-course,Very light overview.,4
data-science-course,Simple and to the point. I recommend this class to any data scientist or manager planning to supervise a data science team or plan projects based on data analysis. This class would make an excellent review for early PhD students in any science field.,5
data-science-course,Excited for the course!,5
data-science-course,"I wanted to like this course but It felt entirely too academic in terms of both the subject matter and the way the specifics of ""data science"" are presented. The course content reminded me of my time a few years ago when I was enrolled in a Ph.D. program at a major Tier 1 research university. The professors were great, but the content was esoteric and incredibly focused on research based ""data science"" and less on business analytics or more practical applications of data science for the working professional. I felt myself re-watching the videos to try and understand the content because there were many instances where the professors' spoke about some fundamental aspect of data science but failed to provide some real world context. I liked the course but I would not recommend it as a crash course for the working professional, more like a crash course for someone who already has a degree in statistics/math/engineering who is looking to further their studies in an academic setting where research is the main goal.",3
data-science-course,"The courses in this specialization are - in my opinion, excessively short.",3
data-science-course,A nice starting for those wanted to understand data science.,4
data-science-course,Awesome!,5
data-science-course,"I enjoyed this class very much. It was concise, precise, and digestible. Not to mention the instructors kept it lively though out the course. Thank you for such an informative course.",5
data-science-course,"Advises are really good. The course charges too much! A one week course should set a reasonable price, for instance, $19.",4
data-science-course,"A very articulate orientation, which meticulously arouses interest about different corners of Data Science.",4
data-science-course,I got all the basic information about what is data science and what a data scientist should do. Thank you,5
data-science-course,Very insightful little course introducing what data science is and what it's used for. Would love to see more of this group's work.,5
data-science-course,"Quite fast-paced indeed. Even the instructors seem like they're in a rush :)It would have helped if there was a glossary of terms for people who aren't well-versed in programming basics.But in summary, it's an interesting course =)))",4
data-science-course,"too basic, the 4 courses of this specialization could be just one course.",2
data-science-course,"Highly Enlightening for those who just beginning to learn data science,The courses are very detailed and well organized,All the aspects of the data science are introduced in intriguing mannerThank you",5
data-science-course,"Too theoretical, e.g, comparison between statistics and ML is not at all useful. Too many quizzes after very short classes and on topics of absolutely generic things.",2
data-science-course,Good overview. I would,4
data-science-course,I left with a good understanding of the reach and dynamics of the field of data science. Even with experience in using data to answer questions in the context of an organization this has been a good way of mapping out the areas where that experience can be extended.,4
data-science-course,"This is an amazing short course, covering the basics of data science. Must-do for all (aspiring) data scientists or management working on data science projects",5
data-science-course,"A very good intro to Data Science by three experts. Well-paced, with reasonable quiz questions and can be completed in less than a week. However, I would certainly not pay for it, because it is feels more like a well-designed ad for the spesialization that follows!",4
data-science-course,Great course to start learning about Data Science.,5
data-science-course,"As the name suggests, this is a Great kick start to understand what is data science. This course have given me a an insight into what is this big name Data Science is all about. As a Statistics graduate and a Software Implementer, I feel that my domain has taken a Thanks Brian, Jeff and Roger.",5
data-science-course,Good overview of Data Science - peaks interest but doesn't go into depth of any subjects,5
data-science-course,The crash course was easy to understand. The classes used good examples to give you visual details about the subject and the instructors were clear and precise.,4
data-science-course,"1.Concise and well structured.2. Allows me to think about the core and the essentials.3. Creates the basics on which I can learn further, deep dive and build expertise.",4

data-science-course,As a complete novice to the field I found this course really useful to get a concise overview and understand some of the trends in big data/ data science. I liked the way the lecturers highlighted that hype needed to be distinguished from what data science can really do for us.,5
data-science-course,Concise but could already include a basic proyect.,3
data-science-course,Nice one :),4
data-science-course,"For an introductory course, this was really fantastic. It's really high-level, but it gives you a framework to understand the world you are entering into (or considering entering into). This is the first course in the Executive Data Science specialization which is built around topics like hiring a team of data scientists, and managing data science projects. So, this would be a great first class for that. But, it's also a great start for someone moving on to getting elbows deep in R Studio, Python, Hadoop, etc. I think. This is a really friendly introduction to the world of data science.",5
data-science-course,very useful for amateurs,5
data-science-course,"Good course, with general and not over-detailed explanations of all the relevant topics in data Science. A good, general overview definitively worth working on.",3
data-science-course,very helpful!,5
data-science-course,Awesome short introduction about what data science is about. If you don't have a lot of time but want to get acquainted with the field of data science you should take this one.,5
data-science-course,Good One.,4
data-science-course,"The course offers a solid overview of data science. If you have little to no familiarity with the field, I recommend taking a few hours to go through the course.",4
data-science-course,Short and sweet :),4
data-science-course,"short, but useful course :)",5
data-science-course,A good course to begin with data science,4
data-science-course,It's really a nice introductory course for Data Science!,4
data-science-course,"A really useful introduction to what is data science. I found it very complete, besides maybe I would have liked a little more deepness in some concepts. I'm willing to learn more about the subject, maybe I will complete the whole specialization.",4
data-science-course,Very interesting course.,5

data-science-course,"I really liked it. Some of tje jargon was a bit technical though. But overall really appriated the opportunity yo learn,",4
data-science-course,Very general course. Doesn't give much insight into data science.,2
data-science-course,need to get a bit more specific about the tools required,4
data-science-course,boring,1
data-science-course,Great introduction into the world of Data Science. I appreciated the 3 different lecturers who each brought a different aspect of data into light.Thank you all.,5
data-science-course,It's very great course for understanding data science.,5
data-science-course,it's a shame to split a one month course to four.,1
data-science-course,"Very basic course. If you know about data science, data analysis, or machine learning, you may find this class basic or boring. Good intro course for those who have no prior knowledge",3
data-science-course,Very nice introduction in Data Science to have a good overview of the discipline,5
data-science-course,Very good course to understanding the nuances of Data science and various tools used.,4
data-science-course,"Good for introduction, start kind of 4 stars but get way better with the further lectures",5
data-science-course,"Overall a compact course, illustrations could be better.",4
data-science-course,A good course to start to learn data analytic vocabulary.,4
data-science-course,Very shallow,2
data-science-course,A great brief introduction. A good starting point for other Data Analytics/Science coursework.,5
data-science-course,This course is too short.,2
data-science-course,Excelent as basics course,5
data-science-course,A good introduction to anybody interested in learning what is data science.,4
data-science-course,Quick and informative for those new to data science.,5
data-science-course,"It provides a quich shot on data science, but the way it presents is not so interesting.",3
data-science-course,Quick scope of data science. I particularly liked the discussion about fad versus fact towards the end of the course. Some questions in quizzes seemed a bit arbitrary. The course delivers what it promises; crash-course with the key ingredients for understanding more about what data science is about,4
data-science-course,It was a great course .You can get idea about Machine Learning from this as well .Relevant information about data science .Well explained examples .Got clear knowledge about data science .Goof course .,5
data-science-course,Very crash course that gives you a taste about the different aspects of data science and makes you want to dive in the specialization program right away!,4
data-science-course,"A good introductory overview of data science. Grounds you on what you can & cannot do with data science. I find defining the question really impactful. Teachers were enthusiastic and the brevity of the course gives it good appeal for beginners who want to ""get their feet wet"".",3
data-science-course,Good intro to the concepts. Not technical at all.,5
data-science-course,Very Helpful!!!!,5
data-science-course,Good introduction of a few essential key concepts.,5
data-science-course,I enjoyed this course. It gave a quick and thorough,5
data-science-course,Very good overall introduction to data science (DS). I would go for the other 3 in the specialisation.,5
data-science-course,"great introduction to field, but there is lack of examples of bad usage data science methods and tools",4
data-science-course,Great for an overview of the different aspects of data science.,4
data-science-course,"I really enjoyed this course, it gives me lot of new, interesting knowledge about data science, But there are some mistake about good (clean) programming. Please do not use comments, the comments show strange code, do not write big function etc... Clean code book from Uncle Bob helps me a lot of to write clean, maintainable code.",4
data-science-course,very small and easy to understand and worth to take,5
data-science-course,Fantastic overview of Data Science avaible to all public,5
data-science-course,This course was truly a crash course with less crashing and more succeeding on the parts of the professors. My only suggestion is to more clearly outline and link the next classes in the specialization.,4
data-science-course,"Offered me a great refresher on the basics, in a very short period of time. Great course!",5
data-science-course,"quick and fun, quite like a crash course",5
data-science-course,The course was very well covered and explained the basics properly. A good starter if one wants to know what Data Science is all about.,5
data-science-course,Only one week. Not much depth.,1
data-science-project,This course created by John Hopkins was designed for thinkers,5
data-science-project,"For me this project was harder than all other courses combined but, because of that, also more rewarding! The theory is very scarce so you're on your own, that's what makes it hard. Once you get the theory right the rest is easy. I learned a lot of NLP and let me practice ""Pitchs"" using diferent R tools.",5
data-science-project,"Great course, challenging and fun. I have learned a ton in a short time.",5
data-science-project,"With this course I learned to go through a data problem from the scratch and get a real data product, and document it. My only constructive comment is that, when reviewing the projects of classmates, there is a huge dispersion on the effort and quality of the products presented, from very basic and simple Apps to a very professional products, and the scoring of them all is quite the same, perhaps one or two points of difference, in eleven points maximum score.",4
data-science-project,"Wow i finally managed to finish the specialization!! definitely learned a lot and also found out difficulties in building predictors by trying to balancing speed, accuracy and memory constraints!!!",5
data-science-project,"Excellent to start in data science. Nothing learned deeply but you understand how you can improve. Now I can improve by my own or choose other courses based on my experience, interest and capabilities.",5
data-science-project,Excellent course and project!,5
data-science-project,"Very interesting, but Capstone is much more difficult than the rest of the course.Be sure to study carefully the first courses, and don't rush.",4
data-science-project,"The main reason for my rating is because the course is so ""loose"" on what your are supposed to achieve incrementally every week that it can lead to some hard situations.Just to give my example: the first week was piece of cake and I didn't feel like it really contribute for the following weeks. Then, I was struggling with the suggested library (tm) until I got support through the discussion forums and someone suggested me to use quanteda.Then thinks started to run smoothly, or so I thought. When implementing the language model (which, at first, I thought was supposed to be KBO), I got stuck for a long period. Not because my model was wrong (I was able to implement it and to check it against some hand-written and proved examples - which I should probably thank again), but because I was not able to make it run efficiently enough for the given constraints.Being stuck in this stage for longer than I wanted, I had to sacrifice another important steps of data analysis pipeline in order to not jeopardize my final delivery by not meeting the final due date. I know that this is exactly what will happen in the ""real"" life, but I think that some better guidance could guarantee the students spent a more even amount of time in across all steps.All things considered, I think the Capstone was really interesting and likely took more than the 4-9 hours per week, but most of this is probably because of the problems I faced.I believe that with a better guidance on the paths to follow or maybe some suggested libraries to use, a lot of ""noise"" (useless difficulty) could be removed and this course would definitely get more starts.",3
data-science-project,"In my opinion, this course is a waste of time, it simply throws a bunch of links and terminology for you to google and research. The project is interesting but once again, you have to do tons of research and take up other courses to fill the gaps (might as well do the other courses instead of this one).I do not recommend this course or the specialization.",1
data-science-project,"Although this project is very open-ended with little guidance, it definitely requires the ""full-stack"" of data science to complete.",4
data-science-project,A very stimulating and challenging capstone. It is stretching and puts all the 9 specialization courses material to use. It also gives the student a glimpse of what Data Science in real life is and touches on Natural Language Processing as part of AI.,5
data-science-project,best course ever,5
data-science-project,NLP is a total different thing and should be a course by itself. I would prefer a a large scale machine learning capstone where we could make models and it would fit better to real life situation! Through all the courses I worked hard only to reach NLP capstone? this doesn't feel right! Please fix it!,1
data-science-project,My name is Jose Antonio. I am looking for a new Data Scientist career (https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseantonio11)I did this specialization to get new knowledge about Data Science and better understand the technology and your practical applications.The course was excellent and the classes well taught by teachers.Congratulations to Coursera team and Instructors.,5
data-science-project,clear and easy course which gives a basic understanding of working with data. Great inclusion of the tools that are useful for presenting your data analysis.,5
data-science-project,"Thank you Roger, Brian, Jeff",5
data-science-project,This gives a picture about the data science in live.,5
data-science-project,Simply brilliant ! Fantastic exposure to Natural Language Processing! Learnt a ton about various NLP algorithms for anyone who aspires to be a Data Scientist !,5
data-science-project,"It's been a challenge to learn all these new concepts and package them into a working product in such a small period of time. I am glad of the things I learned. Also, in my opinion the materials / resources given to this course are scarce compared with previous courses of the specialization.",3
data-science-project,Not enough information on how to approach the final project. The project itself is very time consuming with lots of self learning and unclear specifications.,2
data-science-project,it could've given more instructions!,3
data-science-project,This is a fantastic finish to a brilliant specialization. I gained real usable skills and a lot of confidence doing the capstone.,5
data-science-project,Really great course to apply all the techniques learned earlier in the specialization.,4
data-science-project,This course was great. I went from having a decent grasp on statistics and a little knowledge of software like SPSS to being employed as a data analyst where most of my job is using R.,5
data-science-project,I liked it. The final project was a challenge but it was a good test of all the data science skills I learned over the whole course. Thanks!,5
data-science-project,Self pace and with a lot examples and discussion forum support,5
data-science-project,"This class was a huge challenge for me, but it pushed me to learn a whole lot and practice many of the skills that I had learned in previous courses! I had a lot of fun, too. Thanks!",5
data-science-project,"Good scenario and a good learning opportunity. I don't think the quizzes related well to the problem we were trying to solve and introduced a red herring, however. Predicting the next best word is not the same as predicting the relative probability of 4 words where one is the ""right answer"" but not necessarily the best prediction of a text prediction algorithm.",4
data-science-project,It awesome that you can have the opportunity to learn so much just online. Thanks!,5
data-science-project,"The Capstone Project makes you summarizes what you have learnt so far and take it to the next level, natural language processing . Besides, the ability to create a working app is a reward by itself.It is challenging and interesting at the same time.",4
data-science-project,Really nice proyect to recap on everything you learned!,5
data-science-project,Good test of what we learned in the courses.,4
data-science-project,"This is not for beginners with no experience. The estimated weekly hours are absurdly low.No one has seen any sign whatsoever of the industry partner, SwiftKey, despite claims they will be around to help. The field has advanced dramatically since the course was developed. Be prepared to do a lot of research and trial and error.The specialization has been an excellent way to learn a fair amount on the topic, but it is just the beginning. The capstone will challenge you. It is rewarding when you complete it.",4
data-science-project,Excellent first step for Data Sc,5
data-science-project,"This course is unlike all the others. Although you will need information gained in the previous nine modules, the Capstone Project requires you to work on a long and difficult problem using your own initiative. Mentors, tutors and Swiftkey employees are lacking throughout this project.I worked through many different R packages to generate the word prediction N-Grams because R has a tendency to run out of memory. Many students are forced to use a cut down version of the three million lines of text because of memory issues but I managed to find the proverbially needle in the R packages haystack that allowed me to use the entire dataset!I had problems with publishing the presentation to RPubs - it just would not work using either RStudio or RConsole but at least I had a fall back position of placing the presentation on my own website.It took me three attempts to complete this project, nine months (Jan-Sep 2016) and about 300 hours in total, I didn't give up so nor should you, you can do it! And Good Luck! Hope to chat with you on the Data Science Specialism LinkedIn Group for Completers!Finally was it worth paying for all of the certificates. Yes, it was!",5
data-science-project,"The Capstone starts well with sufficient guidance. The second part gives much freedom however, it might be overwhelming and unclear at times what to do next. However, I loved going out on my own and slowly learning more and more on the subject.You can pretty much choose how much effort you put into it.",5
data-science-project,Difficult but really useful,5
data-science-project,"The course has nearly nothing to do with the previous themes. I already have had enough knowledge, but as there is no support by the team it seems to be rather time consuming for others.",2
data-science-project,A good & fun idea to implement. Would have prefered implementing my own idea though.,4
data-science-project,"Overall a good course that makes you learn a lot on your own (unlike the rest of the series). Maybe a bit too much self learning. However, if you can complete it does give you a lot of learning especially in some text analysis which hasn't been covered before.",4
data-science-project,"This was essentially a self-study project with some social peers. The topic, approach, and standards were different from all of the other units in the Data Science specialization. I found the other units more enjoyable.Learning the essentials of NLP quickly is necessary to begin the project. I ordered a textbook, for example, and I was fortunate that it arrived quickly. If NLP is a prerequisite for this capstone project - whether in the form of a prior class or textbook knowledge - this should be indicated clearly on the course description page.Nevertheless, the main learning that I achieved with this course was in the area of software engineering - specifically, how to take advantage of vectorization in R to achieve reasonable computing performance. While this is a valuable skill, it doesn't seem the proper focus of a capstone course in a sequence focused primarily on other topics.As noted elsewhere in these comments, there was a complete absence of any traditional teaching support. Learning outcomes suffered as result. The missing resources included instructors, mentors, partners, and learning materials.The course site notes an expected time requirement of a few hours per week. My commitment was 20 hours per week, under some pressure. Numerous students take this ""course"" multiple time, in order to arrange for reasonable software development time.Producing working software was fun, as it always is. The course learner community was supportive, which is fortunately typical for Coursera.All in all, this project was *not* an effective capstone for the Data Science specialization. The project was interesting in its way, but it felt 'parachuted in' to this learning sequence.",3
data-science-project,Good and interesting project.,4
data-science-project,"As a capstone to a series of courses that covered data science and R, I found this one to be a bit lacking. There was no involvement from the professors at JHU or the folks at SwiftKey. As was mentioned in another review, the course feels abandoned. All you get a few short (two minutes or so) videos that give you little in the way of instruction or direction. Basically, they just say, ""Go do this. Good luck!""There were also no Mentors or TAs to guide students or answer questions. It was the students helping each other through the forums. Sometimes it was helpful and everyone involved learned something. Other times, it was the blind trying to lead the visually-impaired.On a positive note, you will use all of the skills from the previous courses: writing R functions, performing exploratory analysis and publishing it via RPubs. Your final product will be displayed for everyone via ShinyApps and a presentation using R Presentation (also published via RPubs).On a(nother) negative note, the topic of Natural Language Processing is not an easy one to just walk into and feel confident in providing a working next-word prediction algorithm in about eight (8) weeks. You're reading academic journal articles, watching multiple videos from another Coursera course (which actually focuses on the topic of NLP, and takes place over several courses and several months!).Supposedly, there is work going on to update the course, so hopefully future students will get a better experience. I did take a bit away from this course, especially since I made more than one attempt to complete it. However, it was definitely a shock to find myself missing those things that one typically finds in a learning environment -- descriptive background, assistance to problems, etc. -- and seeing that I was for all intents and purposes on my own. Even in the professional world of data analysis, I have never experienced the lack of support that I found in this course.With that, I am giving it three (3) stars. As I said, I did learn a bit, but it was a bit of a struggle that required multiple attempts to complete. This would have been better off as a stand alone topic (which it already is by another Coursera affiliated school), or having a capstone course that builds on a topic more in the wheelhouse of the JHU professors: a capstone project focusing on bioinformatics or biostatistics would have been amazing in comparison to this.",3
data-science-project,"Hi, the prject was nice and at the end I learned some new things, but it didn't have people to provide any guide. In the videos it was said that personal from SwiftKey will be there as well as JHU teachers could provide some insights. It looked a bit like a phantom course",3
data-science-project,"I enjoyed the course. This course took me waaaay more time than I thought because I struggled with a few issues. First, I wish I'd started by taking the NLP online course before starting the Capstone (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aMYz1tMfPg). There was an issue installing RWeka, RJava and it took me several days to work through the issues. I eventually moved to using quanteda (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/quanteda/vignettes/quickstart.html). I also waited far too long to develop a method to test my model using a subset of the training data, so I could test whether changes to my model improved and reduced performance. It turns out that my model trained on a 25% sample performed just as well as a model trained on 100%. I'm thankful for the Discussion Forum and final peer review process. Both helped me learn how I can improve my model and demo application. I really appreciate the instructors for creating this specialization. I've learned a lot.",4
data-science-project,Nice capstone project. It leaves a lot of room for experimentation!,5
data-science-project,"I loved doing the capstone project for the Data Science specialisation. I applied all the skills I learnt during the length of the specialisation on Coursera. Having completed this project, I feel more confident about my skills as a data scientist in solving real world problems.",5
data-science-project,"Of all the offerings in the specialization, this one felt like it was thrown together in less than hour. I expected to have to learn quite a bit of material on my own, but even the references to additional materials were very thin.I could have saved many days if more guidance on the project workflow would have been given. The pre-processing of the data was quite extensive (9 steps before generating the ngram tables I used in my model) and was the key to getting decent results IMHO, but one had to step on a quite a few landmines to figure this out.The problem was an interesting one and I ended up reworking it after passing with 95% (the only class in the specialization I didn't get 100% on) because I didn't have time to implement much of what I had to figure out by 'hard-knocks'",2
data-science-project,A poor end to a poor Coursera specializations.,1
data-science-project,"The sequence of activities in execution of the project envisages multiple interactions with your peers and unfolds your creative aspect to churn out a solution to put all the learning into practice!Cheers, DSS team - Brian, Jeff and Roger 😁",5
data-science-project,This is a great capstone project. It requires the student to really have an understanding of the concepts learned throughout the specialization and apply them to build a prediction app. There is very little guidance asides from the discussion forum which could be discouraging at first. Otherwise I would've rated it 5 stars.,4
data-science-project,Great way to build up knowledge & experience ....A challenge considering the actual time needed for the Capstone project... but worth every single effort.,5
data-science-project,I hope it will involve statistics analysis in the capstone project. It is kind of bias to apply NLP knowledge and develop data product in the capstone project.,2
data-science-project,I liked every course in this specialization except,3
data-science-project,"I currently taking this capstone and I must unfortunately say that this is the most worst course in the whole specialization. Of course the topic NLP and word prediction is interesting, but the problem is, that this is a dead course. A couple of students in the forum strugeling with details, but there is NO Mentor, no Professor or other course staff and no SwiftKey engineer as announced in the Project Overview.So everything you have to figure out completely by yourself and this takes a lot of more time than the 4-9 hours. And also why should you pay for a course where you learn anyway only ba your own.Pick any intersting topic you would like to work on and invest the time in this instead of paying for this Capstone without any support form Coursera, JHU or SwiftKey.",1
data-science-project,good,5
data-science-project,Practical approach to learn Data Science.,5
data-science-project,Great course for learning data science.,5
data-science-project,"Unfortunately this project is not fully aligned with all the previous program, which is a shame. Ideally, the project was more related to quantitative data, or have compulsory module NPL. It was certainly a very important learning, but very stressful to have to grasp NPL and do the project in a short time.Learning NPL in short time in a DIY way without any help it was very negative and stressful.",2
data-science-project,"I had no experience in natural language processing before I took this course, and now I'm kind of in love with it! Some of my fellow learners complained about the new data type and little information provided, but I feel this is a good simulation of real world experience as a data scientist! The field is constantly changing, so we have to be ready to cope with unfamiliar problems and come up with creative solutions. Due to other commitments, I was once 3 weeks behind the weekly deadlines, but finally poured all my efforts into this and deployed an App in time... You never know how much you can accomplish before you are forced to do a ""Mission Impossible"" ;-) I think I've improved my hacking + googling skills, and built more confidence over completion of this course. Thank you, JHU and Coursera!",5
data-science-project,"Was a great course. There was no hand holding, this is the capstone so it was time to put everything to use on a problem that wasn't outlined for you and required you to self study and work with others to deliver.",5
data-science-project,Coursera lost my thoughtful 2-star review so I am replacing it with this. I learned a lot through my own efforts and through the efforts of students who bothered to post in the forums. The one mentor disappeared half-way through the course.,1
data-science-project,Great practical experience!,5
data-science-project,"Well-paced, highly structured Capstone that allowed me to put to the test the skills I honed during the 9 previous courses in the JHU Data Science specialization. Strongly recommended.",5
data-science-project,Excellent course and this module! Makes you feel sort of real work :) Lots of interesting findings while working on the project.,5
data-science-project,"The capstone project doesn't fully utilise d knowledge from earlier modules such as Machine Learning, statistical analysis, regression models n etc.",2
data-science-project,Very disappointed with this final course. Little to no support. Discussion Forum provides some level of help but you are basically on your own.Very challenging to come up to speed with Natural Language Processing techniques if you have never taken any class about it.My recommendation to JHU and Coursera is to add a separate course for NLP where you cover all the basics and then have the Capstone.,2
data-science-project,Most stressful but interesting. Not enough material was provided,3
data-science-project,"Could be better. The teacher sometimes explain the concepts in a hard way, and not always shows how to do in practice.But you will get curious and in case of doubts, you can find more simple explanations on the web, and the forum is very good.The assignments are hard, you will need do research to accomplish then, but is the best way to learn.I think the specialization is good to someone without much knowledge on the field (like me). But it's only the start!",3
data-science-project,"Amazing project! At first glanse It looks strange, but de facto it's standart data science problem: you should analyze raw data, clean it, build some models and make data product. I highly recommend this capstone.",5
data-science-project,The course is outdated and abandoned by the teachers.SwiftKey engineers are nowhere to be seen.There is no guidance.,2
data-science-project,"The course allows you to gain some interesting experience in text mining. If you're into this thing, you can do really nice coursework",5
data-science-project,need more details,2
data-science-project,"None of the previous classes will prepare you for this one. This is not really a class, but rather a project on a topic NEVER covered in any of the previous classes in this specialization.",1
datasciencemathskills,Excelente curso para reforzar conocimientos,5
datasciencemathskills,"I really enjoyed the course, and found it really useful- it has inspired me to continue on and study applied mathematics at university!",5
datasciencemathskills,"Week one starts with interesting material that relates probability to data science. Unfortunately as the course progress the course material and videos become less and less helpful. Ultimately the student has to visit other web sites and youtube to actual learn the expected material. The course notes are next to useless and the video are equally unhelpful. I am sure the teachers know their stuff but they have no idea on teaching it clearly based on the material presented in this course. Avoid this course, and head over to KhanAcedemy and complete their probability and statistics program and you will actually learn all the material in this course with a ton of examples and top class videos.",1
datasciencemathskills,Instructors made this subject so much easier for me to learn!,5
datasciencemathskills,Awesome Course!,5
datasciencemathskills,"A tremendously useful primer on the fundamentals of data science math. This course is a particularly good option for individuals who have seen some amount of calculus and algebra but haven't used those methods in a long while and need to review. Thorough, easy-to-understand material.I would suggest to the course facilitators that they develop the provided lecture notes -- already a useful tool -- into a full-fledged text. I'm not suggesting something much longer than what they already have, but simply taking that document and adding a bit more rich content. While the notes are useful for more carefully studying the math being done in the lectures, even a bit of effort putting some pedagogy into the notes and combining them into a single document (which I did for the sake of printing) would create a hugely valuable resource.",5
datasciencemathskills,I love this Course!!!!,5
datasciencemathskills,probability theory was a bit fast but otherwise it was awesome!,4
datasciencemathskills,at time the formulas are given without proof or intuitive explanations. overall a good basic level course,4
datasciencemathskills,Great course except for the instructor videos for week 4,4
datasciencemathskills,Great Course!!!!!,5
datasciencemathskills,"First three weeks were mostly review, but the fourth week was incredibly helpful. Would appreciate some more background/derivation of the binomial theorem - it was hard for me to develop an intuition for it in the same way I could for the Bayesian theorem.",5
datasciencemathskills,Very rushed presentation. Blows right through a lot of fundamental concepts without a deep enough explanation or enough practice material (especially in the last two weeks). I feel like completing this class will require supplementation with better instruction.,2
datasciencemathskills,-,5
datasciencemathskills,"This course is very short. I've completed it in about 4 hours. Nothing was told about linear algebra, statistics, optimization. It is not enough even to learn Data Science.",2
datasciencemathskills,"Very condensed yet accessible material. Great invitation for further, more deep dive studies!",5
datasciencemathskills,Difficult content not explained well by the presenters.,2
datasciencemathskills,Excellent course,5
datasciencemathskills,very good knowledge for someone who want to call back prob theory in uni or get an introduction in mathematics problem,5
datasciencemathskills,"Refreshing your BasicsThe whole course is a just brushing up your basic math. The videos are brief and to the point, and problems make you use your brains and they are not right out of the video or any other reading material. I feel only Bayes and binomial theorem videos are not comprehensive and the problems a quite challenging.",4
datasciencemathskills,Material was well presented. Exercises could have been more involved; likely would have enhanced the learning.,4
datasciencemathskills,Too basic. Should give an example on how these math skills are used in data science.,2
datasciencemathskills,Great course covering the fundamentals which I had largely forgotten (not used) since college.,5
datasciencemathskills,Good course to cover all the basic maths related to data science,5
datasciencemathskills,Good course. I feel like Week 4 could have been explained slightly better but otherwise I really enjoyed it.,4
datasciencemathskills,Very useful who wants to start or wants to revise.,5
datasciencemathskills,"If you are a right-brainer and/or rusty on math, I strongly recommend this course as a precursor to Duke's Intro to Probability and Data course. Some of the practice and final quiz questions really threw me (and that's good)... Most of them I was able to rethink and derive the correct answer and a few others remain a mystery... :-)",5
datasciencemathskills,"great course! it was a nice refresher for me, though I still learned new things as well! thank you!",5
datasciencemathskills,Very important Review course,5
datasciencemathskills,Very easy to understand and know how to succeed in the future on the learning path. Thanks a lot !,5
datasciencemathskills,"The material is very useful, however, the second teacher is not the best...",3
datasciencemathskills,A fantastic course for anyone,5
datasciencemathskills,Am glad and happy,5
datasciencemathskills,"The Probability section could use more practical examples, I found it difficult to follow.",3
datasciencemathskills,good materials and questions,5
datasciencemathskills,Very basic course... probably won't teach you a lot of new things,2
datasciencemathskills,"This course is very strong with respect to presenting the concepts you need to know for data science. It is extremely WEAK in terms explaining those concepts. If you are like me and did this kind of math back in the 70's and 80's but have not used it since, be prepared to seek sources outside Coursera in order to understand the material and pass the quizzes. The instructors leave out explanations and skip important points leaving you confused about the concept.Example: In the Permutations and Combinations sections, ""results"" of calculations are thrown at you with no explanation of how the instructor got the answer. 10 minutes later, totally as an aside, you get the explanation. The course is not taught in such a way that A leads to B, B leads to C, and C leads.....; instead the instructor will tell you about C, might explain A, and forget about mentioning B until the graded quiz. That is why you will need to fill in the gaps using websites like betterexplained.com or kahnacademy.com.The student is better served by looking at the syllabus and then going to either of those sites - where the explanations are worth your time.In addition to failing to present steps in a logical order, the course often teaches at an extremely basic level but tests at a much, much higher level. Again, to get to the higher level of understanding needed to pass ANY of the required, graded quizzes, the student will need to heavily utilize outside sources. The explanations on the practice quizzes also fail in many cases to thoroughly explain why an answer is correct.Then there are the issues with Coursera itself, the course navigation using Chrome is quite bad. If I did not constantly monitor what part of a course I should be in versus what part of the course automatically loaded next, I often found myself taking a quiz for which no lectures had been presented. The TA's response to my complaint was flippant and WRONG. She then closed my question and I could not respond or ask for more details.If I had it to do over again I would invest my time and money somewhere else. In my opinion, Coursera should rescind the instructors' rights to charge for this course until the instructors improve and meet higher teaching standards.",1
datasciencemathskills,I graduated with a BS in computer science and mathematics 15 years ago. Since then I've been working as a Business Intelligence consultant and I've recently decided to look into the field of Data Science. I was looking for a math class to refresh my math skills rather than start from scratch and this was the perfect course for that. Kudos to Daniel Egger for creating the class. It saved my a lot of time.,5
datasciencemathskills,Basic math course help to get revise all the high school concept. Even those who haven't any background on mathematics can get it easily.,5
datasciencemathskills,Nice course,5
datasciencemathskills,Great refresher course on the math used in data science!,5
datasciencemathskills,Suitable for high school students. For a University student it can be easily finished in 1-2 days.,4
datasciencemathskills,"I loved this class, the only one of it's kind and much needed, unless you particularly want to re-do your long forgotten high school and college math. It was nice seeing a Venn diagram again. I did have to supplement some of the material that was covered quickly with google searches, but filling in the blanks was quick and easy.",5
datasciencemathskills,nice one!,4
datasciencemathskills,the course is designed at a good speed and provide necessary information.,5
datasciencemathskills,"One of the best course, i have ever learnt. Even though i have been learning the Data Science for the last few years, i had no idea how the algorithms are working in technical. Which i was always skeptical. But honestly, now i am able to get things really faster than before. I am very happy, i have joined this course. Thank you so much for coursera to bring this course and importantly thank you so much for the professors to explain things in an easy for the people to understand. God bless you both and your family.",5
executive-data-science-capstone,"Overall, very useful syllabi have been designed. I wish for more detailed, or at least less repetition of materials in videos and notes. Some of the terms have not been defined for me, so further research was necessary.",4
executive-data-science-capstone,Great learning experience! Thanks a ton to the John Hopkins University for offering such a wonderful course!,5
executive-data-science-capstone,It was great to see how does it work in real life. I wish there was more example and more challenging scenarios. I did enjoy it.,4
executive-data-science-capstone,It was a great experience,5
executive-data-science-capstone,"There were a couple of bugs, but it was a great way to close a very well-designed course.It felt almost like a game!",4

executive-data-science-capstone,"the interaction with DataCamp is awesome!! love the data science capstone, I even felt under pressure from time to time, like if I was managing a data science team for real!!",5
executive-data-science-capstone,Great experience!!,5
executive-data-science-capstone,Excellent project implement your learning and see the results. Very well planned as the last exercise.,5
executive-data-science-capstone,Great capstone! Wish it went on a bit longer :),5
executive-data-science-capstone,Capstone project was very interesting and engaging in its interactivity. It is simple but not trivial one.,4
executive-data-science-capstone,"Great mix of theoretical concepts review and hands on approach.Good interaction flow, nice dialogues and great material. Great learning experience.",5
executive-data-science-capstone,"Fantastic and Fun end to an extremely enjoyable specialization, that was also very educational. Thanks!",5
executive-data-science-capstone,"Although it felt strange viewing pre-recorded videos who address me as a team member, and although I had difficulties to into this 'I am now the manager' role, I somehow liked the people recorded and I liked the sequence of the capstone. It wasn't difficult, it was overall just enough to achieve learning. I am actually quite impressed where online learning goes. Well done to all designers of the module!",5
executive-data-science-capstone,"I liked the way the Capstone is structured, it's really engaging! However, I think it was oversimplified (I was expecting something more difficult that really challenged me and examined most things I learnt during the first 4 courses). Overall, a great experience though.",4
executive-data-science-capstone,Probably the best online class I've ever done! Loved the simulation and how it went beyond things we learnt in class and required making several context-specific decisions.,5
executive-data-science-capstone,Quite easy to do it. I was expecting something a little bit more challenging.,4
executive-data-science-capstone,Really realistic and fun! But it´s almost impossible to grad less than 100 after two attempts.,4
executive-data-science-capstone,This required nearly no effort and is probably of little value in the real world.,1
executive-data-science-capstone,Exceptional !!,5
executive-data-science-capstone,was fun and engaging,4
executive-data-science-capstone,Fantastic. This was the first time I had taken up a simulation based test. Was definitely an immersive experience,5

executive-data-science-capstone,"Was not very challenging, I was looking for more detailed discussions. Good job",4
executive-data-science-capstone,Great Experience ! Extremely morale-boosting after weeks of preparation and study !!,5
executive-data-science-capstone,this was fun and really cool!,5
executive-data-science-capstone,"Very good overview. I did the full data science course but I'm a senior manager, so this was nice to get some organization perspective. Some parts might be a challenge for some IT people, but if you want to manage big data projects, it's worth the effort.",4
executive-data-science-capstone,5,5
executive-data-science-capstone,Short but to the point...,5
executive-data-science-capstone,Exceptional way to launch into the field.,5
executive-data-science-capstone,Very useful to put in practice some of the learnings obtained,5

executive-data-science-capstone,Very accurate representation of how it looks to work with a data science team. Great job!,5
executive-data-science-capstone,Terrific way to bring together the course. I have a background in knowledge management and I really liked this learning approach.,5
executive-data-science-capstone,"A fun way to end the courses.About the reading material for all of the courses - please proofread and edit the reading material. There are so many grammatical errors and typos that it made it difficult to read. (The non-word ""wanna"" was used many times!)",5
executive-data-science-capstone,It's very cool idea to visualize the decision making process. Thank you!,5
executive-data-science-capstone,"Fun and real life problems, is easy but would be cool to make it longer and a situation in which real several problems are found.",4
executive-data-science-capstone,Great fun! Attractive way of education.,5
executive-data-science-capstone,The capstone project was really good and felt like a real project where the manager is tasked with the decision making.,5

executive-data-science-capstone,Fantastic overview course!,5
executive-data-science-capstone,Great concept. Perhaps a little bit too easy to complete :),4
executive-data-science-capstone,Very interesting and related to a real project Assignment,5
executive-data-science-capstone,Useful as a necessary step towards finishing the specialization only.,1
executive-data-science-capstone,"Total disappointment. This was only clipping through a tool, not a real capstone project.",1
executive-data-science-capstone,This capstone was really fun!! Manager material :D,5
executive-data-science-capstone,"By far, the best course in the specialization but yet too easy to complete.",4
executive-data-science-capstone,Very interesting and got me thinking about what is the most appropriate decision to make.,5
executive-data-science-capstone,"The class was a little brief, but I really did enjoy the way it was presented. The real life situation, with videos, and a famous company made this hit close to home. I really enjoyed the ""choose your own adventure"" format of it as well. Unfortunately it was so brief, where the $49 price seemed a little high in comparison to the content that was available in the other sources in the Executive Specialization series. I also would have liked a longer or more in-depth scenario. Lastly, for any of the ""wrong choices"" that were chosen, a debrief ""why"" they were wrong would have also helped. Even though there is room for improvement (and thus a 4 star rating and not a 5), I really did enjoy it and found it to be a very enjoyable way to end the series.",4
executive-data-science-capstone,Great course,5
executive-data-science-capstone,The app is neat but too short.,3
executive-data-science-capstone,Excellent,5
executive-data-science-capstone,Very poorly constructed with links in the final exam that didn't work so I couldn't finish the exam. Then I was graded after only finishing 4/5 of the exam. I managed to get everything straightened out but it took some effort.,3
executive-data-science-capstone,Fabulous way to live the lessons & put new skills into action. Loved it!,5
executive-data-science-capstone,I loved the virtual environment. It was an engaging experience and really felt a sense of accomplishment in the finale video. This was very rewarding!,5
executive-data-science-capstone,Excellent!I is a really good idea about the game,5
executive-data-science-capstone,Very nice and creative.,5
executive-data-science-capstone,"great for existence human and android based life-form simulation internal lifestyle...The course improves life within the simulation 10 fold at least(when combined with the other specialization courses) ...Perfect learning tool for those who have worked professionally in research field sin our simulation and yet now have a touch of ""the turrings"" or you know : CBI...Special thanks to the designers of the course.Top scores for coursera.org &John Hopkins ...",5
executive-data-science-capstone,I wasn't as challenged as I thought I would be with the Capstone course.,2
executive-data-science-capstone,great experience,5
executive-data-science-capstone,The capstone experience was really wonderful. Thanks for all these huge efforts and knowledge.,5
executive-data-science-capstone,"Maybe I'm biased, since this is my first completed specialization... but this is the kind of course-structure and capstone that I would enjoy doing for any and every subject!!",5
executive-data-science-capstone,"Fun. Challenging with gamification.Maybe it's a little short.I was expecting to put in a lot of work in this capstone maybe because I was expecting a more thorough, longer analysis challenge.So a recommendation is:In the same style, create more weeks where the challenges will increase.",3
executive-data-science-capstone,"Disappointing, thought it would be more involved, perhaps with a real presentation graded by other participants in the course. Was interesting to watch the videos, but it was a 10 minute job. The other parts were OK, but after the Capstone I would hesitate to recommend the course.",1
executive-data-science-capstone,"Thanks for creating short course for busy business pearson.But, it is too gamificate to (professional business managers) educate. In addition, this is the lack of contents.For improvement this course, I strongly recommend you to add create presentation and peer review assignments. This is the issue of the Coursera( included other MOOCs) Open Access Education philosophy.",1
executive-data-science-capstone,"Good case to touch the practice with Zillow, the real estate online and involve with the data science team members.",5
executive-data-science-capstone,"Too short, too easy, and did not result in a project that I can show potential employers.",3
executive-data-science-capstone,This was very well done- high quality and fun!,5
genomic-data-science-project,Really practical project in the genomics field!,5
genomic-data-science-project,Great course. Thanks to professors and peers. Ready to use now.,5
genomic-data-science-project,Excellent set of assignments to apply multiple tools used in the specialization!,5
genomic-data-science-project,Very much helpful course. I appreciate it.,5
genomic-data-science-project,"By conducting the capstone project, I applied essential concepts and tools to analyse genomic data in order to understand interesting biological processes. The tasks were well designed and explained. The peers in this learning community were ver supportive. After taking this specialization, I feel confident in integrating genomic and transcriptomic data analysis into my plant biological research. THANK YOU!",5
genomic-data-science-project,Great course! I can't think of a better way of putting together all we learned during the whole specialisation in one real world research project...,5
genomic-data-science-project,"No clear explain about which is the right dataset to be downloaded, no support from instructors about that on discussion forum.",1
genomic-data-science-project,"The first round of the capstone was separated in time by about 6 months from the initial courses, so the lack of additional material was rough. Otherwise the process was a good real word application of NGS processing.",3

intro-data-science-programacion-estadistica-r,"El curso fue bastante básico y la carga de tareas fue desproporcionada para el tiempo, la semana 1 y 2 contenían actividades muy cortas pero la 3 fue un poco más extensa. Soy consciente de que es un curso introductorio, pero tal vez el método con Swirl debería cambiar un poco para no tener que escribir exactamente lo que el programa pide, así los usuarios tendrían que pensar un poco más",3

intro-data-science-programacion-estadistica-r,"Así es como deberían ser todos los cursos de programación. El curso está muy bien organizado y dura muy poquito (4 semanas), lo cual es más que suficiente, ya que se cubren de sobra las funciones más básicas de R (además de alguna no tan básica).El profesor ha explicado las clases con suficiente calma como incluso para tomar apuntes durante la explicación.Antes de hacer el curso, pensaba en R como un lenguaje demasiado complejo. Es cierto que es un lenguaje con muchísimas funciones, algunas demasiado concretas y especializadas, pero después de hacer el curso me he dado cuenta de que existen una serie de funciones básicas con las que se puede hacer un montón de cosas de forma relativamente sencilla, sobre todo en cuanto a operaciones matemáticas sencillas, funciones estadísticas elementales y representación gráfica. Todo ello, mucho más fácil de realizar si se utiliza el entorno de RStudio, que también se explica someramente en este curso.Hoy en día, con tanta demanda en el sector del Big Data, este lenguaje se ha convertido en una herramienta esencial (puede que la más fundamental de todas) muy requerida en el mercado laboral.En resumen: Todo perfecto por mi parte.PD: Aunque algún alumno se ha quejado del funcionamiento del sistema de evaluación de tareas, a mi me ha funcionado perfectamente (solo he seguido con cuidado las instrucciones que se dan en swirl). Supongo que esa puede ser una ""pega"" a la hora de elegir este curso.",5

machine-learning,"A great course given with passion and clarity. Great to listen, a lot of fun doing the programming excersises. Through nicely prepared examples it gives a good understanding on what is the machine learning and how and when to apply it. Would love to continue learning.",5
machine-learning,私はソフトエンジニアですが、これまで機械学習という課題に取り組んだことがありませんでした。このコースを受講することで、機械学習に関する知識を得ることができました。まだ機械学習について深く理解できているという自信はありませんが、このコースをやり遂げたことをきっかけにさらなる学習に取り組みたいと思います。,5
machine-learning,excellent,5
machine-learning,Very good course! The vectorisation can be a bit confusing if you are not very familiar with it.,5
machine-learning,"Great course, great teacher, great level of detail applied.",5
machine-learning,It was a great course .I learned most important things of machine learning with this course easily and gain a great foundation for deep learning and data science.I would like to thank great sir Andrew NG.,5
machine-learning,I love this course. But you have to be comfortable at Math to understand everything.,5
machine-learning,如沐春风,5
machine-learning,"I think this Machine Learning course quiet challenging, although many of concepts are simple but programming in Octave (Matlab - Open source version) need some dedication.",4
machine-learning,Excellent course! Thank you professor Ng explaining the concepts of Machine Learning in an easy to understand manner.,5
machine-learning,Excellent High level overview of Machine learning topics.,4
machine-learning,"Great course! Instructor is excellent in not just explaining the concepts but more importantly pick examples from real-world applications. The review questions and programming exercises are very good for enhancing understanding of the concepts.I understand that in order for this course to be accessible to people with all backgrounds some of the deeper stuff are not covered such as derivations to some of the math formulas. This is OK. However, for people with a stronger math background like me is it possible to add some optional videos for those deeper stuff? The optional video on multi-variable Gaussian distribution is a great. There can be more stuff similar to that.",5
machine-learning,"Excellent course! Andrew Ng, thanks for your great effort to share it out.",5
machine-learning,Incredible course given by a super teacher. Extremely well explained topics even when complicated. Still cannot believe this course is free. Thank you Andre Ng.,5
machine-learning,"Excellent introduction if you are starting in the area. The course does not dive into the (surely complex) mathematical base concepts, showing just what is needed to apply the concepts. Not a lot of real world in the excercises though, you have to take the course and then search for some scenario where you can train what you learned by building something practical on it. I most certanly would recommend it to a friend who wishes to get started in Machine Learning.",5
machine-learning,"Revisión las herramientas básicas, con recomendaciones para su uso adecuado, incluyendo ejemplos de casos prácticos. Muy útil para comprender el potencial de estas técnicas y comenzar con su aplicación.",5
machine-learning,This course is very well planned and designed for people who are looking for a starting point to learn Machine Learning. The pop quizzes are also very good and thought provoking. I was looking exactly this type of course to kick start ML,5
machine-learning,Excellent course!,5
machine-learning,amazing course!,5
machine-learning,"Initially I was skeptical if I would be able to focus and complete the course. Though I had a slow start and off-and-on but after week 2, I got addicted to this class and I was surprised that I could focus with dedication and complete it. This was possible because the course was well structured, smooth transition of topics and continuity, well explained with good practical examples, well balanced with machine learning concepts, and mathematics. The quiz's really made us understand better as I had to redo some quiz's. The programming examples increased my confidence.Good part is,while going thru the course and as I learnt new algorithms,I was getting lot of ideas how I can use this in my current work and how it would help things get better.Great job !! and Thank You.",5
machine-learning,Very simply put. Covers just the right amount of math to ensure concepts are internalized and yet course not made super technical. Allows people of all levels to attend and take away enough from the course to get started or even manage a team of other developers who would in turn need technical details.People wanting to follow data science implementation are free to specialize and delve deeper into whichever aspect they want.,5

machine-learning,very well explained and illustrated course giving insights of some complex computations of applied mathematics,5
machine-learning,"Great course on the fundamental principles around ML. A good combination of theory and practice, including challenging exercises. I would recommend making an update to reflect recent developments and perhaps adding a subtrack of more practical / close to 'real life' exercise",5
machine-learning,"very good, suitable for machine learning beginners",5
machine-learning,"The topics were great.Would have been nice, though, to start from scratch instead of filling in some specific functions. We end up loosing sight of the whole process.",4
machine-learning,very helpful course for entering into the machine learning world. 1st step to AI,5
machine-learning,easy to understand and very useful,5
machine-learning,I learnt so much more than a standard session at uni! This has encouraged me to continue with MOOCs alongside my degree to improve the quality of my learning.,5
machine-learning,Falta legenda em português em alguns vídeo na primeira semana.,4
machine-learning,"Wow.. I can't believe it's finally over. This course has been fun and uplifting to learn. Not only does he explain extremely difficult concepts and algorithms like they're just easy, rudimentary concepts, but he also gives advice on improving applications developed using sid algorithms and gave me such a great intuition on learning algorithms I got confident to work with Math again. Professor Nguyen is a genius and has opened up doors for me which I had convinced myself were beyond my grasp. I currently can't afford to pay for it but would recomend you buy the certificate; I'm going to buy it ASAP not just for certification but also out of appreciation for the great material and life changing experience",5
machine-learning,Great course!,5
machine-learning,"Andrew Ng is an amazing teacher. For me as a physician, with little statistical background, there was a lot of work for me to do to understand all the math. But with the clear explanation in the video's, it was fun to learn and complete this course. Thank you Andrew Ng.",5
machine-learning,Excellent course - great & complete introduction,5
machine-learning,"Excellent course. In my experience really good teachers are uncommon. Andrew does an amazing job of leading this class. The material reflects lots of thoughtful preparation and Andrew works through it in a very engaging manner. I found the conclusion very touching. There's a bit of that throughout the class. As to the content itself, given I'm new to ML it's hard for me to say how thorough or deep it is. It does cover a *lot* of ground and I did find it challenging.",5
machine-learning,Very well thought and thorough introduction to machine learning algorithms with strong emphasis on practice and real-life application of the discipline.,5
machine-learning,"This course is very useful for me, The best Machine Learning course, Thank you NG :)",5
machine-learning,Very good course on machine learning!It includes useful matlab exercises to put in practice what we just learnt.I highly recommand it!,5
machine-learning,"Great course, explain very well concept of machine learning.",5
machine-learning,My First Coursera.. and I absoluted love it!! Thanks Prof. Ng :),5
machine-learning,Best course ever,5
machine-learning,"Great course! A lot of material covered by the lectures. Each video is very clear and the quizzes are really useful to make sure everything is well understood. I'm glad that the assignments use Octave (even though I was sceptic at first and wanted to use python), it makes it really easy to quickly implement the algorithms and visualize the data. During the assignments, I appreciated the fact that we are deeply guided through every step of the exercises, especially for the first exercises. I think that it would be a little more challenging if we were a little less guided for the last exercises.When I enrolled I didn't know anything about machine learning, I have now acquired valuable skills. Thank you!",5
machine-learning,Loved a lot~,5
machine-learning,Thank you Professor. I have learned a lot from the course.,5
machine-learning,"This professor is very very good, i can understand everything even without know very much calculus. I watch other courses and i can't remember when i saw a very good teaching like in this course.",5
machine-learning,"This is an excellent course for two reasons: first the video lectures are very good, introducing complex concepts in a relatively accessible manner, and second the automated submission system is good at marking your (well designed) assignments.What could be better: compared to a traditional (physical) course, I miss the notes. It would be very useful if there was some form of notes, either as an informal textbook or cheat-sheets for each lecture.Another improvement would be that in some cases, it's possible to 'solve' the assignments without necessarily understanding them. This is because you are sometimes given 'too many' hints or the transformation of the existing code to the final form is rather trivial.Overall an excellent course though.",5
machine-learning,Very nice course.,5
machine-learning,Thank you Andrew. Really appreciate your work.,5
machine-learning,Excellent course.,5
machine-learning,Thank you for all Andrew!,5
machine-learning,"This was a very enjoyable introduction to and overview of machine learning, from the perspective of someone who doesn't want all of the detailed mathematical justification for the machine learning algorithms, but does want to see the nuts and bolts of how they are implemented. For example, we don't prove that we have the partial derivatives of the cost functions (or, even, really justify what partial derivatives *are*), but we do see how they are used as the input to gradient descent routines which let us optimise systems such as linear regression. It is an ideal course to use as a springboard for different aspects of machine learning, such as the Neural Networks course which is also on Coursera.The main lecturer is clear, and does a very good job of explaining some of the practical aspects of machine learning, and when you might choose the different optimisation techniques.",5
machine-learning,"Fantastic course, well taught by a well-known expert in the field. The programming assignments were well-constructed and gave real insight into the application of the algorithms and methods.",5
machine-learning,"I found the course to be taught exceptionally well. Andrew is clearly passionate about ML as well as educating the masses about it. The use of real-life examples is a fantastic learning aid, in the videos and in the programming exercises. I enjoyed learning Octave and performing the weekly homework; the exercises showed me how to perform tasks simply that would seem impossible to a lay person. My eyes have been opened and will look to future-proof my career by continuing my studies in ML.",5
machine-learning,"Great course, which covers different areas of Machine Learning, with practical examples and real life use cases.",5
machine-learning,Very good course for learning Machine Learning System,5
machine-learning,This is an excellent course to learn machine learning. The course is well structured and designed to teach even the advanced concepts in a simplistic manner.,5
machine-learning,"It's probably the best course available on coursera. This course not only gave me a solid foundation in machine learning, but also encouraged me to pursue my Masters in this field itself. I will be joining a full time MS this year, thanks to the motivation I received because I enjoyed this course so much. I can not be any more grateful.",5
machine-learning,Awesome. Must as a starter in Machine learning,5

machine-learning,This course shows its students the most useful and used tools for machine learning being at the same time broad and deep.I Highly recommend it to anyone willing to get introduced to artificial intelligence.,5
machine-learning,"Really great course. Easy to learn even though it touches some difficult subjects; the exercises have a medium difficulty, but they are easy to complete using the provided information; and the lectures are very complete yet fun to watch. An excellent introduction to the field of Machine Learning.",5

machine-learning,Thank you Andrew Ng and Coursera for this very helpful course.,5
machine-learning,"Probably the best MOOC course on Machine Learning. Professor Andrew Ng is a great teacher - he makes complex algorithms and concepts very lucid and easy to understand, especially for people with no ML/ AI background. The course is very well structured and gives useful practical tips. It does get quite intense at times, especially the vectorization parts in the programming assignments - but the Discussion Forums are a huge help. Many thanks to all the mentors, especially Tom Mosher for his guidance and valuable insights. Two small pieces of feedback -I ended up spending a lot more time on the programming assignments than on the videos themselves.The concepts were clear but the vectorization really made it very difficult to complete the assignments. Is it possible to use some other package instead of Matlab/ Octave, which is perhaps a little more high level and has functionality to do most of the stuff?The second suggestion/ feedback is : I found the time estimates to be very aggressive for a beginner with no ML/ Octave background. So, most of my study planning would routinely get off track. Not sure if most of the people taking this course found them to be OK.Is there a way to download Professor Ng's lecture notes for future reference? Not all the information is present on the slides. And it is difficult to bookmark videos - lecture notes would be a great help.All in all, this was a very interesting course - one I would recommend to colleagues and friends to take. Many thanks to Prof Andrew for his guidance !",5
machine-learning,"I have to say that Andrew Ng is really good in explaining all the concepts. I was very impressed with the all the details that was put in the lessons. Also, he was always encouraging at each steps and that was very nice. He clearly showed modesty when in fact he could have brag about his own skills. THANK YOU MR. NG! It has been a true pleasure. Alain Duriez",5
machine-learning,"A pretty cool intro to machine learning, though I'd loved to have more mathematics, I'm sure that it's made this way to match most peoples' needs, Prof. Andrew is a great lecturer",4
machine-learning,The best introductory course to machine learning.,5
machine-learning,nice,5
machine-learning,One of the best courses I have reviewed and certainly I enjoyed completing the programming exercises. For the lectures though I have gone through Prof. Ng's original Stanford lectures in greater details. It gives anybody without any ML experience a very nice overview of the algorithm and practices.,4
machine-learning,This course is perfect and suitable for those who have interest in machine learning techniques and has begun or is beginning to learn about it. This course does not require much maths and prior knowledge and is highly recommended.,5
machine-learning,The best machine learning course ever!,5
machine-learning,Very good,5
machine-learning,The course is surely amazing! My suggestion to improve it even more is to add shorter exercises so we could train before taking a bigger step (the assignments). Thank you guys!!,5
machine-learning,"ML theory and techniques are explained really well and the practical parts reinforce the learning and helped to gain ""implementation"" experience.",5
machine-learning,I really understand that Machine Learning is high levels of math.,5
machine-learning,"With acceptable technique using in data mining, Andrew did give us some intuition in ML. Although it need to further learning on some Bayesian rules and math, but it's really worths it.",4
machine-learning,"Very easy to understand and useful course. I would like to thank Professor Andrew Ng for dedicating his time in the elaboration of this course. I would like further versions to have something about reinforcement learning, hidden markov models and naive bayes algorithms. However the course was great and I learnt a lot!",5
machine-learning,Quite low level of detail - skips over lots of the underlying mathematics.,3
machine-learning,Just one Word : EXCELSUSty Andrew,5
machine-learning,Great course from a good teacher. Thanks professor Ng.,5
machine-learning,"There are tons of ML classes on internet (even for free), but this one is the A)most comprehensive topics coverage, and B) easiest to understand.I am not saying your will become an expert of ML (obviously) but you would get a full picture of what ML is doing and how will they improve your daily life and work. You still need a lot of math/programming experience to build your own ML system or application software. Having said that, by taking this class, you know where you should start. The 2nd comment is of course a compliment, and requires years of hard work and practical experience to explain such a esoteric topic to everyday people like you and me through simple word and a well-structured agenda.If you have zero knowledge in ML/programming/calculus/linear algebra/statistic like me, please take it and am sure you will get more than you expected.",5
machine-learning,"I was moved, and I cried at the last video that Prof. Ng is saying the appreciate thing. Oh my god",5
machine-learning,"This course worth devoting a lot of private time. I got overall knowledge of Machine Learning. I'm a mechanical engineer and I'm not sure this course help my career. However, I believe that someday this knowledge will help me go through better career.",5
machine-learning,Thanks to Andrew Ng...Have learnt a lot from this introductory course!,5
machine-learning,Amazing!,5
machine-learning,"Great Experience, beautiful course and a lovely teacher!!",5
machine-learning,it is the best class for me.thank you NG.,5
machine-learning,Perfect course !!! I have learned a lot useful knowledges about Machine Learning. I really recommend the analysis method introduced in this course which help to evaluate a machine learning system.Thank prof Andrew Ng.,5
machine-learning,Such a great courses for Student like me with no pre experiences in machine learning and any of algorithms..thanks to lecturer,5
machine-learning,Significantly recommendable for the people who can do self-learning. Prof Andrew always try to teach with easy way. His lecture has good balance for the theory and practice. Also many assignments improved my knowledge and skill about machine learning. Thank you Andrew!,5
machine-learning,Great...!,5
machine-learning,"Thank you for sharing such an impressive training course!Thank you so much to Prof. Andrew Ng, our kind mentor Tom and everybody of you who also contributed to make this a great learning experience.This is one of the best trainings I've done in my life and I really appreciate how Andrew is able to explain easy and ""friendly"" what in fact are very complex problems. He's not only intellectually gifted, but also an outstanding and generous person for sharing his knowledge in such an open way. No ego issues by Prof. Andrew!Thanks again for everything",5
machine-learning,"Professor Ng has done a great job on this course, and the supporting resources (including the discussion forum posts from the course mentors) filled in any gaps I encountered. This was a much gentler introduction to machine learning than some of the other tutorials and books I've tried, yet it was still thorough. I gained a solid foundation from which I will have a much easier time understanding more advanced resources.I have some linear algebra background and a lot of programming background, and I felt that the assignments were quite easy. However, I still felt that I learned a great deal in the process of doing them.",5
machine-learning,Brilliant course. Really enjoyed it.,5
machine-learning,"Thank professor Ng for teaching this fantastic class! it is the best online class I ever took, hand down!",5
machine-learning,A very concise first class and the exercises are indeed heuristic.,5
machine-learning,Great Course,5
machine-learning,"Professor Ng makes this extremely powerful tool of machine learning amazingly accessible. I did this course in my mid-fifties & it wasn't easy to work through all those programming exercises (..performing the mental gymnastics necessary to visualize & manipulate matrices in your head), but am now rewarded with not just a clear understanding of the capabilities of machine learning (which is why I initially started this course), but think I will actually be able to try it out on some simple problems.",5
machine-learning,das,4
machine-learning,It's a great and helpful class!,5
machine-learning,非常棒的课程，要是练习能更多一点，或者有后续的深入课程就更好了。,5
machine-learning,受益良多,5
machine-learning,"Outstanding course! Andrew is an exceptional teacher, making difficult and complex topics easy to understand. The course is very well structured in a way that there are no questions left unanswered and you can have a really in-depth understanding of the topics by just watching the videos and paying close attention. I have a degree in electrical engineering, so it was quite easy to follow the course. But I believe that even people with no programming/engineering/mathematical background would benefit from this course, because Andrew makes it easy to understand the concepts and the algorithms formulations. The programming assignments really provides a good practical approach for all the theory given in the video lectures, and the code templates are very well structured to enable even someone with no background in programming to complete the tasks. The functions used and implemented can then be adapted for implementing your own machine learning problems. Overall, great course, I am very satisfied with it!",5
machine-learning,"This is a good course,I learned a lot of knowledge.",5
machine-learning,非常非常非常好,5
machine-learning,Perfect!,5
machine-learning,了解很多机器学习的知识，非常棒的老师，非常好的课程。,5
machine-learning,Its highly recommended course for those who are aspiring to build their career in the field of AI. The course is very well tailored with hands-on programming assignments and short video lectures.,5
machine-learning,"This was my first course on coursera and I very much enjoyed it. It is very well structured, Andrew explained each topic in a very intuitive way, and I feel like I have a very good idea now of what machine learning actually is and how I can apply it to real world problems. However, the coding exercises tend to be a little bit too demanding (at least at the beginning) if you only have little experience with Octave's programming language and if you are not trained in econometrics/statistics. More (optional) coding examples might be helpful at the beginning. Nevertheless, this is a great course and I would recommend it to anybody interessted in machine learning! Thank you, Andrew.",5
machine-learning,Sad to know that I need to pay inorder to get a online certificate.,3
machine-learning,It's very fine course!,5
machine-learning,Awesome Course by Andrew. Loved the pace of the course and the examples shared by him.Only one suggestion: An alternative submission of code in Python Language for assignment submission can be included.,5

The professor was very clear with all the lectures in the videos, also the way to evaluate was really good, with that way was possible to confirm everything that was learnt during the videos. I got really impressived with the way of submit the solutions of the programming excercises. I would like that the course have more mathematical theory, it is good to see the process of derivation or demostration of some formulas, I understand that not all people have the same mathematical knowledge, but for the ones that are interested on that it could complement very well the course.",5
machine-learning,Excellent!!!,5
machine-learning,Fantastic Course! Pitched at the perfect level.,5
machine-learning,"Excellent course that explains the basics and the different algorithms and approaches to solve different types of machine learning problems. It also goes through a number of applications where machine learning is used and I like the project based approach for programming to reinforce what was learned. Overall, an excellent course and highly recommended!",5
machine-learning,"Excellent introduction to Machine Learning. Lectures were informative and interesting, and labs were not too difficult to figure out. Was even able to use this as a replacement for my university's first Machine Learning course.",5

machine-learning,b,5
machine-learning,One of the best coursera's course,5
machine-learning,I like this course so much. It is really helpful. The way ahead is full of AI and ML.,5
machine-learning,"I found the course very interesting and intuitive. We covered what seems like lots of content fairly, but in enough detail to have a working knowledge of machine learning. The course, being 11 weeks, seems long, but I was able to complete the course fewer weeks than allotted.",5
machine-learning,感谢老师授课解惑，受益匪浅！,5
machine-learning,"Great course, I've learnt a lot from Prof. Andrew Ng. Professor explained well on several complicated concepts that I used to be confused about, and he has carefully chosen the material to make it easily understood.I am really grateful that such course is provided for free, and I shall buy this course as my appreciation for such a wonderful platform.",5
machine-learning,Great course. Very easy to grasp. Assignments are to the point and designed in a very neat manner.,5
machine-learning,"Very nice course, I enjoy it really, I find it detailed and clear!",5
machine-learning,Exceptionally good course. I learned more than I expected. Thank You so much.,5
machine-learning,thank you!!! i love it!!!,5
machine-learning,This course equips you with all the skills needed to build your own machine learning system. I found this course extremely useful at work where I had to build such a system and I didn't have any prior experience with ML in college.,5
machine-learning,"Couldn't ask for a better experience. Professor Ng nailed it with this little gem and it's easy to see why it's so popular with online learners. Exceptionally organized and appropriate level of difficulty for folks with a technical background. If you're coming into this course without at least some programming background and matrix math experience, expect some concepts and programming assignments to be challenging.",5
machine-learning,"It is a FANTASTIC course! I've learned a lot of Machine Learning from this course. And I hope I could use them in my work for real applications! Thank you, Andrew! Thank you, Stanford! Thank you, Coursera!",5
machine-learning,"Excellent course that covers lots of material. Dr Ng is very patient and elaborate in explaining the concepts. Very useful and exhaustive, knowledge packed course.",5
machine-learning,"Excellent course, very well thought out. The lectures are paced well with concepts encapsulated in relatively succinct lectures. The explanations are clearly laid out. The programming assignments are focused on the concepts with all the supporting code provided, and include excellent visualizations to see what is happening, step-wise confirmation that your code is working, and are interesting to boot. As someone with a background in matlab and linear algebra I found the assignments pretty easy but are a good introduction to those not used to high level programming and keeps the bar of entry low. It's not as rigorous as a typical undergraduate course but it was perfect for those of us who are not full time students.",5
machine-learning,"The lectures are great, but the assignments are way too easy. It gives little grasp of the difficulties involved in ML.",3
machine-learning,Great course by one of the masterminds of Machine Learning. It was a great experience learning from Andrew. Highly recommended!,5
machine-learning,"This course is realy interesting it was detailed enought to understand the math of the machine learning whithout loosing the fact that those algorithm needs to be implemented and have a real application in industry. I am a Web CTO and always wanted to dig in this facinating topic, I am now going to implement those algorithm and make better products!Thank you Andrew Ng!",5
machine-learning,I believe that this course is a good course for starting the journey of Machine learning,5
machine-learning,"This is the best course in ML. But to start in ML this shouldn't be the first place you should go, first do the 'Intro to ML' in Udacity then come to this for better understanding of maths.",5
machine-learning,"Well structured and inspiring lectures, the lecture notes are clear and easily to read. The assignments are challenging enough.",5
machine-learning,"Honestly, this was such a great course. 11 weeks ago I knew very little about machine learning ( mostly just buzz words like neural networks, deep learning and so no). Andrew was a very good teacher, taking time to explain fundamentals of linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, support vector machines, case studies and more. It takes time to complete it, but it's a time spent well.",5
machine-learning,Very interesting and easy to understand.,5
machine-learning,"splendid course, a great start in the study of Machine Learningshow us an overall view of study with interesting programming casesThank you, Andrew",5
machine-learning,Probably one of the best machine learning online course if not the best. Explanations are very clear and materials are great ! I want to thank especially Professor Ng on making such a quality course and sharing his knowledge freely for everyone.,5

machine-learning,This is an awesome course!! I got to learn various algorithms and application areas. Good for beginners. Must do course for those who would like to pursue their career in data science.,5
machine-learning,"This course if a great one. The most important thing that differentiates it from other courses available online is that here we get an idea of how things work rather than just have a library or a function that does some job for us instead of getting an idea of what it is doing. Also, the way Prof. Andrew Ng taught was simply awesome. I really want to thank Prof. Andrew Ng for being a great guide through his lectures, thank you Sir, and I hope to work in your team someday.",5
machine-learning,The course is great for people at their fist experience as well as for experts. It is fun and interesting work and it opened my mind to what one can do with a computer.,5
machine-learning,"This course gives a nice and broad overview of Machine learning in a lucid way. After completing the course, I could research and study publications and current state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning breakthroughs. I would recommend this course as a platform to get started in the field and then build on it based on your further interests.",5
machine-learning,One of the best courses that I have taken on Coursera. Prof Andrew is simply amazing at building concepts from the ground up and then correlating those with the more complex concepts involved in learning about ML. It's one of the most relevant pieces of course material to today's technology scene and I really liked the focus on actionable material vs.other courses that focus mostly on the theoretical aspect of complex subjects. It was a pleasure learning this course and I will look forward to more such courses on ML and itassociated topics.,5
machine-learning,Excellent! Recommend to everyone who wants to get started with Machine Learning but doesn't know where to start,5
machine-learning,A good mix between theory and practical programming exercises.,5
machine-learning,fantastic,5
machine-learning,I liked it very much!,5

machine-learning,"This course covers many important aspects in machine learning, in a way that is easy to comprehend and process. Learning from scatch, I now know many important idea in this field, and, most importantly, become familiar with the various terminology that everyone in machine learning is talking about. This is a great course, and the learning process has been utterly productive for me. Thank you professor Ng.",5
machine-learning,Great course to begin learning ML,5
machine-learning,A good start for studying machine learning. Much better than directly taking a ML algorithm and try different parameters.,5
machine-learning,The professor explains everything in a very clear and concise manner. I really enjoy taking this class.,5
machine-learning,"Informative, beginner-friendly and fun.",5
machine-learning,Extremely comfortable way to learn. I have some machine learning background from a university course 10 yrs ago so this course was a super way to refresh and learn new concepts.

machine-learning,Teaching content is very practical and helpful in real world,5
machine-learning,"A very complete course for understanding from the beginning Machine Learning and which are the different algorithms and tools you can work with. I strongly recommend it. Also, the programming tasks do really help to ground the concepts",5
machine-learning,"the way Professor Andrew taught is very practical and he not only introduces the algorithm itself but also gives a lot of suggestions on how to use it properly.I know i need to review these when i really confront it, so i am really appreciated for all of this!",5
machine-learning,"Definitely a ""must-take"" course. Machne Learning is an important tool for a variety of branches of science and engineering and Andrew Ng has a great way of turning complicated techniques into easy-to-understand pieces. The programming assignments may require a learning curve for those who have never used a Matlab/Octave environment, especially using the vectorized operations instead of loops but that is also well worth the time and effort. If you check question-and-answer sites on the Internet, you will probably find that this is the most recommended beginning course for related branches of science and engineering.",5
machine-learning,"Fantastic course, the programming is a bit hard for us none coders out there but Andrew does a great job at laying out the models and procedure.",5
machine-learning,One of the great courses that I have ever learnt. Thank you so much Andrew !!,5

machine-learning,Course is a very good intro to Machine Learning. It was taught at a good pace with clarity.,5
machine-learning,"Very good course with lots of valuable advice about application of different strategies and how to approach obstacles that can occur applying machine learning.At times the math felt a little bit repetitive, because, well, loss minimization stays pretty much the same. But better repeat too often than not often enough.My only issue was the usage of Matlab/Octave. I would've much preferred Python or even the (to me) unfamiliar R. But Octave/Matlab was a pain for me, especially as I knew I'd never need it again after this course. Maybe giving a choice whether we use Matlab/Octave or Python would've been nice to accommodate both, people with and without programming experience.",5

The math content - of which, obviously, there must be a lot of - is very well-explained, and Andrew takes care to require little more than a high-school level expertise to understand.The programming exercises were slightly challenging, but not overly so, and helped solidify understanding - and hey, there's always that little thrill of excitement when you see your program begin to give you real answers, and you realise that you've just written a program to recognise letters when given just a bunch of pixels.I didn't use the forums much during the course myself, but they appeared to be very well-supported by knowledgeable and helpful mentors. (Tom Mosher, in particular, seemed to be on-hand all day, every day!)As to Andrew Ng, the lecturer, he clearly has a deep and extensive knowledge of his subject matter, but his presentation is always kind, enthusiastic and helpful, so I'd like to pass on my thanks to him for making and presenting this course.",5

Andrew's lectures were very clear and well presented, the materials and assignments were great quality, and I found his style engaging. He is clearly passionate about the topic he is teaching. Overall very highly rated.",5
machine-learning,"The course has been very insightful with hands-on studies interlaced, and Dr. Ng is a great instructor.",5
machine-learning,"First off, I think the course content is amazing! I really like that the instructor used Matlab that encourages the user to create vectorized solutions to the problems. I have heard many negative comments regarding the lack of use of Python, R, or some other library like Cafe or TensorFlow, but I believe all of that should follow after having the mathematical background to understand these principles. The content is not easy, and requires a fair bit of mathematical sophistication, but not so much to lose me, and hard enough to keep me engaged. I really enjoy how each learning unit builds off of the previous one, for instance, linear regression become logistic regression which becomes a neural network.That being said, I really think that this course needs to have a fresh coat of paint on it. I believe it was filmed in 2008. I don't think the content really has been revamped since its release. The recordings look like they were filmed on an old web cam, not even as good as a modern iPhone. The slides should have some design work on them. I know it seems petty to stress over the presentation, but I think many people are turning to programs from Udacity that are very flashy, but not as technically rigorous mainly, I feel, just because of the presentation. I think that this course deserves a bit of energy polishing it up since it's still perhaps the most popular MOOC course out there.",4
machine-learning,"Excellent course! Machine Learning is a fascinating topic. I really recommend this course, one of the most interesting courses I have ever taken. Andrew Ng is a brilliant teacher.",5
machine-learning,"Very eloquent, simple, straight to the point, while giving real life example.",5

machine-learning,"Really great class for Machine Learning. I went from being knowing nothing about Machine Learning to knowing most of the ins and outs of it. If you have been hearing a lot about Neural Networks and SVMs in your day to day life, you're probably in the Computer Science community, and the reason you hear about them so much is because it's being actively used almost everywhere. A good understanding of basic linear algebra is certainly going to help you in the class, but it's not necessary for completion. Thank you very much prof. Andrew Ng. It has been a great class!",5

machine-learning,"I really enjoyed this course. I believe it gives a great basic understanding of what machine learning is and how you can use it. I feel that the programming assignments could be broken up a little better to assess each section the way the PDF suggests to submit the results. Or at least give an option to bail out of the code if you know you haven't completed the other sections.

machine-learning,"Despite the fact that the most in-demand course is free of cost, Prof Andrew Ng teaches it as best as it can be taught to beginners (like me), who does not know anything about machine learning (altought have to know at-least basic to intermediate maths concepts). The explanation of complex mathematical algorithms and concepts are made very simple and interesting... I hope this turns out to be beneficial and practically useful for me as i progress thought the course.*At the time of writing this review i am currently in week 5. Successfully completed all 4 weeks but in 2 months.",5
machine-learning,"Firstly, an extraordinary course that's offered for free ! My heartfelt gratitude to prof. Ng.",4
machine-learning,"My first class on Coursera! I really learned a lot and enjoyed taking this class by Prof. Andrew Ng. He's an excellent professor and his industry experience and academic depth really shows. He has knack for simplifying complex ideas and highlighting what's important. The programming assignments were challenging and the quizzes made sure you understood the nuances and details of key points. Overall, I really like the Coursera online teaching platform.",5

machine-learning,"Genial curso de introducción al Machine Learning. Se centra tanto en la enseñanza de los principales métodos de aprendizaje supervisado y no supervisado, poniendo especial énfasis en analizar los porqués acerca de su uso o de sus potenciales mejoras y errores al ser aplicados.",5
machine-learning,"Excellent level for presenting the theory. I would have spent a bit more time on the ""homeworks"" because it was quite hard to understand it. I had to use the forums, otherwise I wouldn't make it.",4
machine-learning,It's a well tailored and full of knowledge course. Course content has been picked carefully to cater the needs of first time learners. I really enjoyed studying this course and would be using the knowledge in future work.,5
machine-learning,"Overall, the course is very good.Positives:Great introduction to machine learning if you've previously never studied itCovers core machine learning ideas, algorithms and terminologyBeyond covering the core ideas it teaches you how to do machine learning well - avoid common pitfalls, speed up your algorithms, find the most beneficial problems to tackleI definitely feel I could take on my own machine learning project from beginning to end, based on what I've learned in this course.The course is well organised and well paced so it's comfortable to get through without getting lost.Warnings:The course was more of a time commitment than I was expecting. Keeping up with the weeks is 5-6 hours per week, which is almost adding another work day.In the first 3 months that I was registered I completed 5 lessons. I only completed the whole course by doing a binge where I completed 7 weeks in 6 days. From other friends experiences doing a binge was the only way they got through Coursera courses as well.If you are not familiar with statistics or programming I think you will have to cover a lot of outside material just to read all the mathematical notation and do the basic programming exercises.Although I manage to pass the exercises every week I'm not sure how much of the material is necessarily well embedded in my brain, rather than I just learned it for 24 hours. I think the additional exercises where Coursera has you right up your own summary of a lesson is an effective aid for retaining the material, but those didn't come up often. I would encourage Coursera to have more of those or make them part of the weekly assignments.",4
machine-learning,very comprehensive entry level course for machine learning. Thanks! Andrew and Coursera!,5
machine-learning,"The course gives a very clear foundation for machine learning. The course is by no means complete or comprehensive, but given the vastness of the subject that is not possible either. A substantial amount is covered every week in the lectures, and completing the assignments definitely made me feel like I learned something. The quizzes are well crafted and gauge not just cursory, but deeper understanding of concepts. The instructor, Prof. Ng makes the lectures very engaging, and teaches everything in a structured manner.The only improvements this course needs is with regards to comprehensiveness. For students who wish to delve even deeper into the concepts mathematically, there should be more optional lectures. Lacking that, a list of further reference material will certainly be of big help.",5
machine-learning,Wonderful Course. Had a great experience learning ! Couldn't get better,5
machine-learning,Best. I mean it),5
machine-learning,"Terrific instructor, easy to follow and well paced. Covers a lot of area but the exercises are very much hand holding where your part is just plugging in a few lines of code. I've been doing modeling work for many years and this machine learning course has given me additional tools that I feel will definitely be helpful for solving future problems.",4
machine-learning,"Very good course, the course material is excellent and Andrew explains the topics very well in the videos. The topic is fascinating and is great if you enjoy maths and algorithms. Would definitely recommend to friends who enjoy a challenge.",5
machine-learning,I just finished this course and now dare say I do know and completely understand why all people say this course is the best one and recommend this for beginners.

machine-learning,Thank you！,5
machine-learning,"It is very interesting! I was really satisfied by this course and teacher. But I think, Adrew sometimes pay too much attention for simple details and don't pay enough attention for more complex ones, but it was only few times. In general I'm really glad to study and to finish. Wish you guys all the best!",5
machine-learning,"Clear, concise, and valuable course. Professor Ng's way of teaching is not only very pedagogical but also inspiring.",5
machine-learning,"Mistakes during the videos are only corrected in its review. Often there's a new attempt of Andrew Ng to say something without even cutting out the first attempt. The mathematical symbols sometimes didn't encode at all. The quality needs to be redone, as this was not a completely satisfying experience for an 80USD course.",2
machine-learning,Excellent practical course!,5
machine-learning,Very informative and very well explained. It is just a bit outdated as there is no mention about the availability of machine learning platforms in AWS and Azure for example.,5
machine-learning,"This course is one of the best ML course in the market with deeper true understanding of the algorithms. It helped me to not only get familiar and learn ML algorithms, but my mathematics and logical thinking improved drastically.",5
machine-learning,"The best course about Machine Learning on the web, that's for sure.I've learned so many new things and really understand what's inside it, in a way that I feel secure to explain it to anyone.Thank you so much Andrew Ng and everyone involved in the development of this course, you guys did an amazing work, that's irrefutable.",5

machine-learning,An amazing course by a brilliant teacher!! The course material was perfect for a beginner with a reasonable amount of technical knowledge but not so deep and in-depth so as to not being able to understand anything.The quizzes and programming assignments were the most exciting aspects of the course.The support of course mentors Tom Mosher and Paul T Mielke was incredible with their insightful and prompt responses to issues. I feel though I might have to take some classes in basic statistics and practice programming Octave/Matlab so as to maximize the benefits of this ML class.Thanks Andrew Ng and Coursera !,5
machine-learning,"I found the assignments to be sometimes confusing (i read the description of a question, thought i was supposed to answer several steps at once, only to realise that the tasks would be broken down in muc more detail later). Once i figured out the style, it was much easier, and i would be sure to read entire assignment first. Additionally, i sometimes didnt know whether errata notes were relevant to the code i was actually using, or previous offerings of the same course.Overall though, very good! Thanks!",4

machine-learning,"Nice teacher, nice course!",5
machine-learning,Amazing,5
machine-learning,I am very glad to have completed this course. Clearly professor Ng have a very deep knowledge of the subject since he is able to explain complex ideas in a simple and understandable manner.,5
machine-learning,"This is an extremely basic course. Machine learning is built on mathematics, yet this course treats mathematics as a mysterious monster to be avoided at all costs, which unfortunately left this student feeling frustrated and patronized. So much time is wasted in the videos with arduous explanations of trivialities, and so little taken up with the imparting of meaningful knowledge, that in the end I abandoned the videos altogether. The quizes were basic (largely based on recall of, rather than application of knowledge), as were the programming assignments (nearly all of which were spoon-fed, with the tasks sometimes being simple as multiplying two matrices together).If you are serious about machine learning and comfortable with mathematics (e.g. elementary linear algebra and probability), do yourself a favour and take Geoff Hinton's Neural Networks course instead, which is far more interesting and doesn't shy away from serious explanations of the mathematics of the underlying models.",1
machine-learning,"The course is well-formed, and tutored. To be able to get perfection in ML field, there should be some challenging projects, where students develop it from scratch.",4
machine-learning,Very Good,5
machine-learning,Awesome!,5
machine-learning,Great Course Gave a nice introduction to Machine Learning,5
machine-learning,Wonderful course!,5
machine-learning,"This course has been highly delightful to learn through the concepts of machine learning. For someone like me having 17years programming experience, and with some hands on of neural networks from colelge days, and analytic tools for a few applications in R; it is a great refresher on the fundamentals and great breadth of practical technology elements that are most useful in machine learning applications.Andrew's teaching method is great. His clear and simplistic delivery style of complex concepts with apt examples ensures the student grasps the essence with ease and works navigates his way through complex algorithms with confidence. I would love sitting through his lectures in the future too!Congratulations to the entire team that put together this course and making this a great service that is available for anyone wanting to learn ML!",5
machine-learning,Thank you Ng!,5

machine-learning,Best online course OVERALL there. I totally recomend it,5
machine-learning,A very good starting point to the machine learning domain. The videos are short and the pace is easy to follow. The intuitions explained are really good. The programming sections really helps in understanding the concepts deeply.,5
machine-learning,Great Course! 5 Stars!,5
machine-learning,"This is an excellent course on Machine Learning. Prof Andrew is a great teacher and spends a great deal of time going through specific examples. The working through of examples better enabled me to understand some of the subtleties in the various learning algorithms. This would be hard to achieve otherwise if I had went to read a book directly. Furthermore, Prof Andrew spends a great deal of the course discussing the intuitions behind various concepts which makes me have a better appreciation of the various concepts. Finally, Prof Andrew is very encouraging which further spurs students like me to persevere through this rather lengthy course.",5
machine-learning,Well explained and practical,5
machine-learning,"Has been an amazing experience.Prof. Andrew has planned out the lessons very well to take us through the basics of Machine Learning and inspired me to dive deeper into the subject.The programming exercises have been thoroughly planned out, making you focus on only the algorithm implementation and blurring out other implementation details.The material provided is very concise. Helps understand the implementation, application and basics of all the basic yet powerful algorithms.I would really like to thank Prof. Andrew for such an educational course.",5

machine-learning,"awesome course to give the concept of machine learning, practical skill set, real cases. You never feel far away from Machine Learning after the learning.",5
machine-learning,"Wonderful approach by Andrew Ng on the concepts in Machine Learning. It slowly picks up pace, reaches a crescendo early in the course (In week 5... Man... what an assignment that is)... And a gentle slope about supporting concepts on machine learning later. Without Tom Mosher's helpful tips, inputs and resources, I could not have finished this course. Interestingly, I got to know more about human learning by going through this course. Glad that I took this course and got to learn it.. Thank you Andrew NG & Coursera !!",5
machine-learning,"Awesome course. The words of Andrew Ng that occur quite often here ""If you don't understand - don't worry about it"" - will stick with me in the foreseeable future :D",5

machine-learning,The best course about Machine Learning,5
machine-learning,"Like honestly, what a great course!!! I think i can safely say that this is the best MOOC i have ever taken. Thank you Andrew Ng!",5
machine-learning,Andrew is exceptionally great. He has a way of breaking a complex algorithm down into small steps and explaining them in the context of real world example (which I highly appreciated!). The course has been a blast and this is only the start. :-),5
machine-learning,"This is a great course on the fundamentals and the good practices of machine learning. Andrew Ng is a clear, level-headed pro who teaches a lot of stuff with clarity. The learning curve is constant, and this is great because it really means you can go at your own pace, while being sure that you will get there.Andrew does not focus on the trendy stuff (all the deep learning) as much as on the good practices, and I think this is very valuable.",5
machine-learning,"Great place to start ML! I wish Numpy was used instead of Octave. I've heard people say this is an easy course. Well, when you think of exercises, the solutions are usually just a few lines of cod. But in my opinion, the challenge is to understand each concept so well that you can explain it to an ML neophyte.Important advice: Do ask/answer questions on the forum. I'd definitely recommend visiting the forum when stuck.At the end, I just want to thank Professor Ng and his wonderful staff. I hope to see you guys start an advanced ML course soon.!",5
machine-learning,"More mathematical foundations could be included. Other than that, it has been hell of a lot useful for my post graduation specialization. Thank you Andrew Ng and Stanford (Y)",4
machine-learning,Excellent course and very well presented. Some maths knowledge will be great but Andrew gets you through the basic understanding. Advanced calculus would obviously be beneficial but not required. Great course and recommend it to anyone wanting to understand how machine learning works and can be applied to a multitude of scenarios,5
machine-learning,Excellent intro to Machine Learning!,5
machine-learning,"This course gives me a lot of confidence and satisfaction about studying new areas. I know Dr. Ng skipped a lot of math and reasoning processes throughout the course and I never felt I am an expert of machine learning. But the most important thing is that I realize this is matter of practice, deliberate practice. I obtained the mindset as a programmer and background techniques of utilizing machine learning from this course. Keep working on it.",5
machine-learning,"I learnt much more than machine learning itself from this course. Prof. Ng is a great teacher. The way that he designs and teaches the course is extremely helpful for me to learn new knowledge. For every one who is new to learn machine learning and hopes to learn it, this should be his/her first course. I enjoyed the learning experience so much. Thank you Prof. Ng.",5
machine-learning,Excellent introduction to Machine Learning!,5
machine-learning,"1. Very helpful course for learning ABC of ML. If you complete this course you will find it very easy to follow in more advanced ML courses.2. Sometimes I found the course assignment over-hinted by the mentors. Without knowing deeply you can complete some tasks easily and quickly.3. Expected more programming assignments in last two weeks but last two weeks only have quizzes.4. More mathematical treatment was expected; but that was intentionally avoided by Andrew Ng for this course I guess.5. I missed the summary in text format in later video set of lectures,",5
machine-learning,"legendary courses, vivid and accurate",5
machine-learning,Great introduction to Machine Learning for general audience.,5
machine-learning,"Very helpful. Fundamental get cleared easily with world class pundit Andrew and a guide like Tom Mosher . There are reason why this course is highly sought. A small problem I face is that R programming is used industry wide. prefer more than Octave. Hence finding it difficult to participate in any race. Nevertheless with fundamentals from this course, R is just another language. Moreover there are pre-built packages and platform for machine available in the net. What one needs is strong fundamentals.",5
machine-learning,Awes,5
machine-learning,Excellent course to learn.,5
machine-learning,"I like very much the course, I recommend it. I would have liked learned more MATLAB parallel to the course.",4

machine-learning,"It's a great introductory course to ML, especially for those who are absolutely new to this field like me. Thank you Prof. Ng and all the Coursera mentors and staff who made this course a wonderful journey into ML.",5
machine-learning,"The course is nice as an introductory course to ML and set the path to learn more in the field. Many algorithms are not covered in much detail and programming assignments are also limited in terms of completexity and innovation. I think it all depends on the learner to really take skills from this couse and start applying them outside of the course to real problems, join tougher courses and dive deep into the algorithms taught in the course.",4
machine-learning,"Well constructed and easy to follow, but lacks mathematical derivation.",3
machine-learning,Best course!,5

machine-learning,一定要好好做习题,5
machine-learning,Very clear useful course in a great design. Thanks Andrew Ng!,5
machine-learning,"Very good course to understand and implement a large range of machine learning solutions. The only drawback I see here is the very poor level of mathematics contained in the course (it can be seen as an advantage for some), but less time spent on explaining basic maths and some dedicated to show the demonstrations behind the formulas would have been perfect!But apart from that, the pedagogy of the course is close to perfect, Andrew makes it really logical and easy to understand ! I have spent a great time.NB: for those who find his course too slow, I found that speeding the videos *2 is a very good solution!",4
machine-learning,Very well put together course .,5

machine-learning,"I learned this machine learning course. This is my second course about machine learning.Pros. [1] Mathematical backgrounds are well introduced. If their proof is quite long, the proof is omitted. [2] This course provides chance to construct major machine learning formulas using MATLAB/Octave. [3] Resources offered at last seem to be very useful to deepen my study on machine learning. I am going to use the references as a compass.Cons. [1] Audio quality is poor. As an English learner as a second language, this makes me spend more time to capture the meaning of speech. [2]",4
machine-learning,"Thanks to Professor Wu, I have a clear picture on the Machine Learning concepts. Hoping that Professor could provide other courses. Besides, the pdf. slides of this course is exquisite and they are easy for us to review the lessons.",5
machine-learning,"Great course, each session starts with mathematical fundamentals of the topic for fully understanding and ends with practical implementation and programming assignment!",5
machine-learning,"Excellent! I'm amazed at how much I learned. If there's is an Academy award for online courses, this would win the ""best picture"" award (and I wish there is to help highlight well-developed courses). Lectures, tutorials, resources were great, clear and most importantly, effective in communicating concepts, algorithms and developing the necessary programming skills (and I'm saying this after trying many others and giving up mid way). I have no doubt that this course will continue to stay relevant and evolve as this field as well as online delivery format progresses. I'm very very thankful for having access to such wonderful training material, made possible by founders of coursera, which I understand to include Prof Andrew Ng. I'm also very inspired by how coursera democratizes access to courses from top universities.",5
machine-learning,"For me, it's the best course about ML.",5
machine-learning,"Andrew Ng's Machine Learning class was five stars! The course had a very good balance of depth, examples, and exercises. Prof Ng always seemed to know where more explanation was needed and always provide intuitions to help understand the material.",5
machine-learning,Fantastic course with well thought out programming assignments,5
machine-learning,dope,5
machine-learning,Good introductory level course. Good code assignments at the end of each week.,5
machine-learning,"This is a great course to give intuition about the major machine learning concepts. The course explains the mathematical background on an intermediate level that is just perfect to get one started on this track but not too much detailed so as to focus on the subject instead. The homeworks are very well planned and interesting, maybe a bit even too easy to complete, but lots of fun. Professor Ng is a great lecturer and I liked his style and presentations so much, that I will definitely take his other courses as well. Thank for the journey!",5
machine-learning,"Interesting, engaging and well-taught course. Everything is explained clearly and extensively. Course popularity helps too, there is always enough participants in the forums to provide interesting tips and feedback. And mentors are active there too. Recommended!",5

machine-learning,I really enjoy the course and assignments. It is one of the greatest on-line course I have ever attended !!!,5
machine-learning,An excellent course that teaches the basics of Machine Learning in a pleasant and understandable way. Highly recommended!,5
machine-learning,"Overall I feel the depth of the information and difficulty of the assignments is well balanced for a free online course. With barely any high level math knowledge I was able to complete the course fairly quickly. Even though the notation was sometimes hard for me to read and decipher. I appreciated the explanations in text form a lot (the lecture notes and the programming tutorials). They really helped tie the whole thing together. Sometimes hints in the pdfs for the exercises would confuse me rather than help me.I think professor Ng is a good teacher. Pleasant to listen to. The explanations in most of the video were fairly easy to understand. Going over graphs and visualizing what was going on was really helpful in understanding the algorithms.I really like the practical tips as well, where it was explained how to analyze performance of an algorithm and what can be done to improve it based on clear metrics.Thanks to all those involved for creating this course. I feel I understand a lot more than I did before I started but I also know this is just the tip of the iceberg.",4
machine-learning,very good explanation and assignments.,5
machine-learning,非常有用的一门课！我们走入机器学习的殿堂打下坚实基础！,5

machine-learning,perfect,5
machine-learning,Perfect course to get familiar,5
machine-learning,Amazing course,5
machine-learning,"Very Excellent Course! I love this course because: the quality of the teaching is really high, Andrew NG is very clear and is able to really make you a ""grip"" on the concepts because he first give you an intuition on the problem and the solution, then he explains the solution and how to deal with it. It is clear that Andrew has a very deep experience as a teacher because he knows how to explain things. Moreover, he is very competent and well prepared so a high quality professor and education. The course is well composed, spanning through very useful topics. The assigment are super useful because you really ""work on"" code and you think about it. The assigments sometimes are not easy but it worth working on them because it is the only way to evolve. At last...this course saved my life in a bunch of machine learning job interviews and I could defend effectively from the questions. The ""intuition"" phase about algorithms is made simple and clear, and it is the most useful part for me because now I remember a lot and I can ""abstract"". The mathematical part is pretty basic, provided that you know something about matrices, vectors and derivatives, but nothing too specific: just having a ""grip"" on basic concept (just to know what they are and how to use them) is sufficient. So i really recommend this course to anyone would like to start with machine learning, because I already took certificates of other Data Scientists Coursera Courses and believe me, as far as I know, this is the best, well balanced and most effective course. Thanks a lot Andrew!!!",5
machine-learning,Great course with lots of theoretical material and practical advice on how to properly deploy machine learning.,5

machine-learning,Thank you Andrew Ng!,5
machine-learning,Very useful~~,5
machine-learning,"I really enjoyed this course! The lectures we well organized, and provided enough detail to get started, without overwhelming anyone without a CS/Statistics background.The homework and quiz exercise reinforced the lectures, and provide a framework to begin using ML in daily problem solving. I have already found a project at work where I am implementing a simple SVM and linear regression for big data processing in our test lab.This is a great course for anyone who wants to understand what ML is, and how it works from a fairly high level. Much more study and experience will be required for anyone wanting a career in this field, however.",5
machine-learning,"This course was not as exactly as i expected, but was really helpful. Thank you.",5
machine-learning,the best mooc i have done so far. thx a lot to whole team !,5

machine-learning,Muito bem estruturado e objetivo. Não perde tempo com detalhes menos importantes da disciplina.,5
machine-learning,it's very good for our students,5
machine-learning,"Just perfect for learning about machine learning, formal enough to understand the underlying concepts and simple enough to be accessible for almost anyone.The programming exercises are extremely useful",5
machine-learning,This course was well prepared. The lecture content was super organized. I liked all the programming assignment the staff did lots of groundwork to have the framework so we can focus on implementing the most interesting part of the algorithm. The visualization part in the programming assignment was another bright spot!,5
machine-learning,"This course was so effective in introducing me to machine learning and giving me extremely practical experience implementing the algorithms. I really appreciated the programming assignments; very tangible and direct way to learn. Completing them has given me confidence in using these skills and a code reference I can turn back to in the future. I truly appreciate the teaching of Andrew Ng, I have taken many CS classes at UC Berkeley and found this to give just as fantastic instruction as a full semester in person course. Im honestly shocked at how learning can be so much easier through this online format. Thanks again!",5
machine-learning,"Great introduction to machine learning. Lectures are excellent, with not a moment wasted. Maybe the best MOOC on the web today.",5
machine-learning,Outstanding course! it helped me to understand key machine learning concepts.The material is very accurate and clear,5
machine-learning,The best online course I had,5
machine-learning,"Andrew Ng is an excellent teacher, rich with information and experience, in the Machine Learning domain.

Apart from the great course content and its delivery, Andrew's enthusiasm is one of the highlights of this course with the student feeling rearing to go implement great things by the end of it.",5
machine-learning,"My first online course ever was Intro to AI (with Sebastian Thrun and Peter Norvig). All my online courses experiences afterwards were judged by this standard. I learned about this course from a colleague of mine. I am extremely grateful to Mr. Andrew Ng for setting this new standard of online courses for me and for teaching me the basics of machine learning and giving me practical homework in which to practice everything I have learned. The best things in this course were: the videos, the quizzes and most especially the homework system!TLDR: This is the best practical course anyone should do. Your programming and machine learning skills will greatly improve after this amazing experience.",5
machine-learning,何よりです！,5
machine-learning,"Prof. Andrew Ng did a really excellent job in this course for understanding Machine Learning. The assignments, as well as the choice on programming language ensures that the learners can focus on the concept itself instead and less on the nuances of syntax. The lectures are well divided into sections interrupted by short quizzes that allows learners can self-check if they understood that particular segment before moving on to the next. This lesson is perfect not just in teaching the subject matter itself, but also in demonstrating how the lesson can be presented in a way that it can easily be understood.",5
machine-learning,Highly recommend who wants to get into and learn more about machine learning to take this course! The instructor really knows what he is talking about and explains concepts very well.,5
machine-learning,"This course gives you foundation which will help to dive deeper into other machine learning topics. The material, assignments and videos are great. Thank you, Andrew Ng.",5
machine-learning,"Excellent course. Andrew Ng provides valuable instruction on the intuition and implementation of machine learning algorithms. Even better, he gives lot of advise on how to create effective and performant machine learning systems like accuracy metrics and troubleshooting techniques. The main drawback about this material, for me, is that machine learning has evolved since this course's inception. While these are excellent foundations, I wish there was almost a part two for more state of the art material, especially deep learning and an expansion of neural networks. This is just the beginning and it was a great place to start.",5
machine-learning,"Probably the best MOOC I have ever taken, it's one of the grand old ones, one of the first courses ever introduced on Coursera, before all that nonsense of 'specialisations'.Prof Ng experimented with teaching the material using different languages and he decided that Octave was best for ease of learning. I know exactly what he meant now, I would never have realised how useful learning vectorisation would be. I am most definitely going to remember the advice to prototype in Octave and implement in another language if needed.The course is much easier if you have some knowledge of Linear Algebra. You will learn Octave very fast and the concepts will make much more sense.A truly great course.",5
machine-learning,Excellent course covering the main approches to tackling machine learning problems.Has good hands-on programming exercises.,5
machine-learning,"Great course to learn the math behind the algorithms in machine learning. Not to practical, but definitely helpful to actually understand whats going on when you use a library to help you.",4
machine-learning,"This course has been a very interesting and detailed introduction to machine learning. The fact that it focused so much on the theoretical background behind all the ready-made technologies available now allowed me to gain a much deeper understanding of the different technologies, and the ability to decide for myself what tool to use and which approach to undertake.",5
machine-learning,One of the best courses I passed.,5
machine-learning,"I really enjoyed this course. The teacher was amazing, and make simple the most important concepts behind this branch of IT. It is woderful because it enhance anybody to follow this course, even the ones whith no strong mathematical basis. Thank you very much!",5

machine-learning,Best introductory course for Machine Learning,5
machine-learning,"Great course, I recommend it if you start machine learning like me.",5
machine-learning,It is a best course on machine learning and don't think any other content on machine learning can match up with it in terms of clarity and details. It covers various machine learning algorithms and their implementations. Also the quiz and assignments are there for self evaluation and learning.,5
machine-learning,"Extremely good overview of a large variety of Machine Learning Algorithms!The only thing that bothered me a little was that everything was done in MATLAB instead of R or Python, which is probably more natural for most people taking the course. Also, this course is rather directed at people with a programming background that want to get into stats, not so much for people with a stats background that want to get into the programming part of ML (which I was).",4
machine-learning,Great course!!!,5
machine-learning,A great kick-start course in practical machine learning !Andrew Ng puts everything in a nutshell. Thank You!,5
machine-learning,"you learn a lot about machine learning concepts, but you need to have a strong math background as a pre-req in order to appreciate this course.",5
machine-learning,awsome !,5
machine-learning,"Through this course you'll be able to use effectively any off-the-shelf ML library and functions, debugging your implementations, measuring their performance and find a way to do better.. A course designed for CS engineers not for researchers :)",5
machine-learning,Overall a great course. It's hard to believe that it is free.One recommendation: It would be nice to have supplemental readings for the later lessons like there are for the earlier ones.,5
machine-learning,Brilliant course. Just what you need to begin a career in ML / AI.,5
machine-learning,This was great!!I wish there was a training exercise for weeks 10-11.Thanks a lot :),5
machine-learning,"Excellent explanations, well structured assignments, good balance between theory and application. Andrew Ng is one of the best instructors I've ever had.",5
machine-learning,Great overview of machine learning,5
machine-learning,"A very easy going and clear introduction to machine learning. Comfort with manipulating matrices will help make the course far easier but it can also be completed without this background. Finally, not only did it talk about algorithms and there application it provided great tools for assessing model performance to help decide the best way to improve an application.",5
machine-learning,Simply amazing!,5
machine-learning,"Thinking back, I also really enjoyed this course, particularly Andew Ng.",4
machine-learning,This course provides a prime overview of most important topics with regard to machine learning. For me it was the perfect introduction to the topic.

machine-learning,"I would rename this course as Programming Octave with Application to Machine Learning rather that Machine Learning. Once you start the course you will have to focus on Octave rather than on ML topics if you want to do programming exercises. There is no degree of freedom in programming. You are provided with a lot of weird Octave codes which you will have to complete instead of writing yourself from scratch. More than 50% of my time was spent in order to learn Octave and understand (guess!!!!) Octave codes.So, if you really want to learn ML and try it in practice this course is not for you. However, you could just watch the videos whose level is not more that elementary introduction to ML.",1

If you take the time to learn this material well, you will be very well equipped to understand and apply these techniques to any field of research you are interested in.",5
machine-learning,"This was my second course in ML. I took it with the aim of gaining a deeper insight into some of the fundamental topics and I was not disappointed. The professor Andrew Ng teaches the concepts in a way that is easy to understand and reason about. I loved the pace and the way the material is structured. Quizes and programming exercises completed the lectures very well to give a more complete picture of the topic at hand. Actually some of the quizes and specifically programming exercises are quite challenging. This is actually a good thing as the lectures alone would make the course a bit boring and without any practical application examples.I wish the videos were a bit better in terms of video / audio quality, so be prepared to ignore that aspect and just take the incredible knowledge that is given to you.If programming exercises are too hard, do struggle through them and use the forums to solve them. It really helps you deepen the understanding of the concepts that are taught in the class.",5

Prof Andrew has done a fantastic job in creating content, content delivery and setting up the programming exercises. The course Mentors were also very helpful and always available.Couple of suggestions: 1. A lot of complexity exists in creating the data-sets and defining /loading the variables. There should be one topic on data-set creation and defining the key variables (X,y, Theta).2. I feel the difficulty level of the course should be increased. It is a fairly easy course from a programming point of view as most of the code is given or strongly hinted in the resources or by Mentors. The course needs to be ""harder:.",5
machine-learning,Let's get start,5
machine-learning,Fantastic course! Highly recommend it. A really good introduction/perspective on the key details machine learning algorithms.,4
machine-learning,"Excellent introduction to different methods in machine learning. I have some prior experience with machine learning, and although this is an introduction, it gave me a lot of good tips for implementation, debugging and workflow. It also gave me a deeper understanding of the different concepts in machine learning and when to apply the different methods. Questions during the lecture videos and quizzes afterwards keeps up your attention, and the programming assigments make you understand more deeply how to implement and apply the methods on real problems. The programming exercises are mostly pretty easy if you have some experience with programming and matrix/vector multiplication, and some of them are really funny to play with and apply on your own data or pictures afterwards. The lecturer, Andrew Ng, is also very good at explaining, and you never feel that he jumps over unclear details. I highly recommend this course!",5

machine-learning,"Very informative and interesting course, highly recommend everyone to take this. Great learning experience.",5
machine-learning,This was my first approach to Machine Learning. I think this course is a very excellent introduction to this topic. This course also provides a general panorama of these techniques.,5
machine-learning,great introduction to machine learning balanced between theory and practice.,5
machine-learning,"Anybody out there wondering whether they should start with this course or countless others that are available on the web, my advice is to start with this ML course. It gives you all of the basics and introductions to ML, Neural Networks, Back Propagation etc. I tried reading ML books and implemented Sci-kit based ML algorithms, but I kept running into concepts that I had not much knowledge of. Taking this course revealed all of those concepts to me. This course is truly worth your time and worthy of sticking with even when you get stuck after the first few weeks. Persevere and keep learning.",5
machine-learning,It was an excellent course and it helped me in every way a introductory course on machine learning is expected to help. It gave a brief introduction of every topic which comes under the machine learning domain.,5

machine-learning,This class is really of great help for a starter in the field of machine learning!,5
machine-learning,"Excellent introduction to Machine Learning. Professor Ng is highly engaging and has a way of making even heavy subject matter accessible to those with a decent background in math. I found the course riveting and completed it weeks ahead of schedule, not because it wasn't challenging but because I was so interested that I began to use any spare time to hack away at the programming assignments or squeeze in a video or two. I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to know more about the fundamentals of machine learning and its applications.",5
machine-learning,Very good course for beginners.,5
machine-learning,Great class. Learned a lot.,5
machine-learning,"Very good introduction into the field of machine learning, its various algorithms and use cases. Only point of criticism would be that the level is sometimes a little lower than expected. The pace of the lecture could, in my opinion, be a little faster as I found myself skipping through the videos from time to time hopping over the repetitions. Having said that, it's perfect for everyone without a mathematics background!The exercises were very good fun and very well managed through the available material, resources and the discussion forum. At the end of the course one - me anyway - wishes to go back to uni and start studying computer science.",4
machine-learning,I think this was a great course. It goes through high-level concepts as well as digs down into implementation of common algorithms. Professor Ng explains concepts well enough for a novice to easily follow. Would recommend this course to anyone looking for a primer on machine learning.,5
machine-learning,"A great introductory course that is designed such that you don't need a mathematical background in order to understand the concepts. Due to its attempt to maximise accessibility, most concepts are not mathematically motivated, meaning that a person serious about pursuing this as a career will need to do a subsequent course that is more mathematically rigorous. However, it does a great job of building intuition about the algorithms and is a solid base to build on.",4
machine-learning,Excelente!,5
machine-learning,Simply brilliant!,5

machine-learning,Well organized course. Learned a lot. Love it!,5
machine-learning,"This is a very helpful machine learning course for absolute beginners, basically you learn from ABC. You don't have to worry much about the linear algebra backgrounds because the professor will tell you what to know and what is advanced(optional), so you can choose to skip or learn, based on your level. I felt a sharp stop when finishing this course, because I know there are more complex principles behind it to discover, this is not included in this course, which may be a advantage for absolute beginners. All in all, I highly recommended this course to all of you who are still hesitating whether join in this course or not.",5

machine-learning,"This is the best course one can find to begin learning Machine Learning. Almost every basic concept is covered in the course and the instructor has done a great job in organizing the course and the assignments. However, I personally feel that ""DECISION TREES"" is the only frequently used technique in ML that is missing in this course. So, adding Decision trees Concept too would be very helpful and makes the course an equivalent master level course. Thank You.",5
machine-learning,This course introduced me to machine learning as well as made me master several machine learning algorithms through self-implementation. The course structure is very well organised and easy to follow. Assignments are well designed to let students master the concepts rather than spend time on debugging software issues.,5

machine-learning,Teaching technique +Course material +Exercises +Forum help +,5
machine-learning,"As a ML entry course, it is easy to understand its content; and the homework given can help us to further practice what we learned. It is quite helpful. Thanks a lot!",5
machine-learning,"Can't say I am in any way not satisfied with the course, but here are a few personal feelings taking this course: 1. It is basically very straightforward to understand, although some part prof Ng takes extra time to care for some details, which I suspect for some students with solid math/stats foundation will find redundant, but indeed help those who don't a lot. 2. The algorithms introduced in this course are basic but also powerful, and relatively straightforward to understand too. 3. The programming exercises are very carefully designed to help students with the algorithms, while leaving the details of other programming components, which are very very very important to keep students on speed. 4. This course may require a little bit of Object-Oriented Programming language knowledge, and a little bit of calculus and stats to make the studies more smoothly. Thank you so very much prof Ng to have this course shared and this might actually turn out to be one of the most influential series in introduction to machine learning. - By some random fresher in the university",5
machine-learning,The course lit my inner fire about this field. Thank you Andrew!,5

machine-learning,"+ Assignments ++++ The words and terms used in the lecture are very simple. He definitely put some thought in the perspectives of non-engineers. +that calming sentence, ""you don't have to worry about this""- After the week 6, the assignments focuses less on how to use the algorithms, but more on the pre/post processing.- People like me, who solely focus on finishing the course FAST, are likely to ignore the CORE scripts already done for youNeed to repeat it AGAIN",5
machine-learning,"Comprehensive. Challenging. Encouraging. I am very thankful I took and completed this course (even if it took me a couple attempts!). Thank you Coursera, Prof Ng and of course Mentors; more power to you!",5
machine-learning,Very informative - required for understanding the origins and fundamentals of Machine Learning.,5

machine-learning,"Great course, really taught what we need to know for applications while also showing the deeper mathematics involved. I liked how each class had real-life examples to give more context to the algorithms. The programming exercises were also great! They were simple enough for someone to do them without having others look at their code, but were also informative in understanding the linear algebra and implementation of algorithms. For someone hoping to start out in ML, I would highly recommend. It's no wonder every website recommends this course as the best online course for ML!",5
machine-learning,The best machine learning course on ML fundamental knowledge!,5
machine-learning,Really a great course,5

machine-learning,The best Mooc I enrolled so far.,5
machine-learning,"Fantastic course. Great materials, great assignments. S",5
machine-learning,very helpful,5
machine-learning,"Very useful, covers the basics of machine learning. Easy to follow.",5
machine-learning,First MOOC course I have ever taken and it feels like it is the standard to which other MOOC courses should adhere to. Great entry-level course for anyone interested in machine learning. Its worth to me in industry (as a biomedical engineer) remains to be seen but I am confident that I will be able to use the concepts learned in this course to great effect in the future.,5
machine-learning,Very good course! The focus is much higher on the practical aspects than the mathematics behind (which is often the opposite case for university classes).,5
machine-learning,"Very good, easy to grasp, theoretical explanations combined with relevant exercise to put into practice the topic straight away",5
machine-learning,The course was smooth and was taught in a simple way that learner didn't need lots of background in other fields. I enjoyed it and will listen to it more times.,5
machine-learning,amazing class!,5
machine-learning,"This class is presented very clearly. Concepts are explained well, and Andrew Ng abstracts away some math that is not entirely necessary for applying ML concepts very well.",5
machine-learning,"A very clear course, demystifying the basic of machine learning. The level of practical hands-on was sufficient to understand the concepts, but not get overly bogged down in programming minutiae and debugging. Would love to see a ML 2 course to extend the depth new topics!",5
machine-learning,Incredible course! The instructor is so gifted in explaining! I understood the concepts I really needed for my graduate research from completely unrelated field. Many thanks to Professor Ng and his team for doing such a great job on this.,5
machine-learning,Very good course. Very practical and to the point.,4

machine-learning,Excellent overview of major machine learning topics.,5
machine-learning,"Great course! Provides an excellent understanding of the possibilities of machine learning and key details to choose the correct analysis/project design. Only frustrating thing is that programming assignments can be quite frustrating in a way that isn't really furthering your understanding of machine learning. Of course, this is probably mostly due to the nature of programming.",4
machine-learning,simply awesome. thank you andrew,5
machine-learning,"This is a good course in theoretical machines learning but not much integrated with big data computation work. If you have other course related to machines learning with big data, definitely, I must participate it in future. Thanks for your teaching. Excellent Course !!!!",5
machine-learning,课程很赞，收获很大，非常适合初学者,5
machine-learning,"very good course. thanks for Coursera, thanks for Andrew Ng",5
machine-learning,Very good Course to start with,5
machine-learning,I loved this course. It is a great introduction to Machine Learning and how to use it practically with hands-on programming assignments.,5
machine-learning,"Ag's course is super good , he can explain every concept clearly ,he always encourges us ""not to worry about it"" , and gave me more confidence . Finally I completed this course , thank ng , thank coursera!",5
machine-learning,A very useful course!,5
machine-learning,非常好。,5
machine-learning,The best place to learn Machine Learning. The programming exercises were really good. And the lectures were very easy and enjoyable.,5
machine-learning,"I'm just finishing up week 3 of this course. It is really excellent. The instructor Andrew is very good. He doesn't talk over your head like some professors do, and makes sure to explain carefully the concepts",5
machine-learning,I thought this course was an exceptional overview of the different aspects of machine learning and a great way of getting your feet wet before diving into deep learning and neural networks. I would recommend this course to those who are new (or relatively new) to machine learning or those who need a good review of the materials.,5
machine-learning,"Fantastic course. Helped me get from zero technical knowledge of machine learning all the way to the point where I feel comfortable implementing and can think through those implementations. The course itself is very math-intensive and gives a deep technical understanding of machine learning, rather than just a code-based approach. I feel like this is useful, but I would not recommend this course to people with no coding experience or people who are uncomfortable with linear algebra (primarily matrix operations for vectorized implementations of algorithms). My only criticism is that the course moved slowly at some points, but I took time off to take the course in several days rather than over a few months. I imagine the reminders and short review of topics that have already been covered would be very useful to people taking the course at the recommended pace.",4
machine-learning,"I've been enrolled in many many many online courses before, and I honestly never finished any of them. Every time I register, I watch the first week, maybe the first two weeks, and then I dump it. This course is the first course that I actually finish. I worked so hard, and it took me so much time, but trust me, everything is worth this course. Everything here makes the course more helpful and amazing. Also, seeing all the people in the threads from every country and from different backgrounds, having the same passion or spending their times with you on this course is absolutely amazing. I totally recommend it.",5
machine-learning,"Thorough, in-depth, and extremely useful! I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning or refreshing their knowledge of machine learning.",5
machine-learning,"Very clear, interesting, useful, and explained with infectious enthusiasm! I'm already applying what I learned. Totally worth it!",5
machine-learning,"Muy recomendable, con muy buenas guías y contenidos actualizados.",5
machine-learning,"Professor Andrew NG tries to teach machine learning as simple as possible and you do not need to have good mathematic bases to understand the course . He also put tones of works conveying the intuitive of machine learning. In addition, this course has very well-designed exercises.",5
machine-learning,"Great course, and my first experience with an MOOC. I learned a lot, and am already brainstorming ways to apply it.",4
machine-learning,"This course is very well organized and exposes students to some fundamentals of Machine Learning and practical applications of them. Assignments and guidance to complete them from resources, tutorials and test cases are absolutely helpful to learn these basics and their application with an hands on approach and gives students much more confidence on what he is learning and has been able to absorb. There is a lot of complex materials covered in this class which at the beginning looked fairly insurmountable but working the Assignments with help from resources in form of tutorials, test cases to run and of course the very valuable forum discussions and moderator Tom M's continuous help made learning a lot easier than I thought. Finally thanks to Prof Andrew Ng for offering such an well organized course like Machine Learning through video lectures, lecture notes (pdf) and exercise files to make learning more meaningful and much easier to absorb.",5
machine-learning,I thoroughly enjoyed the course.I would love it to also provide some data with objectives / case studies for us to tackle the entire ML problem by ourselves to really cement the understanding.,5
machine-learning,Great Introductory to Machine Learning and a great way to learn it by implementing Machine Learning algorithms.,5
machine-learning,"Great course for those eyeing for a quick know-how. Wouldnt recommend it to those particularly interested in learning the mathematics behind the algorithms. Prof Ng is undoubtedly a great teacher, makes the concepts look simple and easy to understand. In short, I d rate 5/5 as an engineer and 4/5 as someone interested in the math.",4
machine-learning,Tremendous! The pedagogical approach is great and the exercises are well designed: completing existing code allow anchoring the learning without wasting hour s on developing.,5
machine-learning,Very impressive for Andrew Ng. Thanks for Coursera's lessons to all over the world!,5
machine-learning,"This is the very first course I have completed on MOOC, and coursera is the first MOOC I have ever used. This course opens the door of machine learning for me, and inspires me a lot! Thanks Andrew!",5
machine-learning,"The content of this course, like many other courses in coursera is top-notch! Professor Andrew Ng has unique ability to explain machine learning concepts in a simple and understandable manner. The course structure seems to have been really thought through as at no point did I feel as though I had a gap in knowledge. I would recommend this course to anybody interested in Machine Learning. Dive in, you won't regret it.",5
machine-learning,I have taken the non-certification course of Machine Leaning by Dr. Andrew Ng. The material covered is this course is adequate and very insightful. In my opinion this course should be a start point for any individual who want to learn Machine Learning. This course provides all the necessary fundamentals with a little bit of math that gives an intuitive sense of the algorithms. I would gladly recommend this course.,5
machine-learning,Excellent! 脑洞大开,5
machine-learning,"Great course with videos and practice framework, easy to understand and learn. Thanks Andrew Ng!",5
machine-learning,"This course has been excellent introduction to Machine Learning. It's one of the best courses I took online. I like that Andrew talks about the guts of the algorithms, explains intuition behind every problem, (and jokes about ML engineers in the Valley all the time). It's been a lot of fun! Totally recommend!",5
machine-learning,"Very complete course, with a lot of theory notions and practical exercises.But the material needs to be updated and revised with the errata",4
machine-learning,The greatest machine learning course that I have learned!,5
machine-learning,Excellent course for machine learning beginner. Easy to understand.,5
machine-learning,"Great at giving a fundamental, necessary understanding of machine learning. The quiz system drove me crazy--not as helpful at reinforcing understanding. Big value is in the programming assignments--helped much more to reinforce understanding.",4
machine-learning,Easy to understand. Great course .,5
machine-learning,"Excellent! Great material, great teaching. Mr Ng made complicated things look simple and elegant",5
machine-learning,"Nice, professional, low emphasis on programming aspect, high focus on practice. Lots of explanations, tutorials, free code samples and explanations are provided.",5
machine-learning,It's a good course for machine learning beginner(s) and there're few samples that really worth to do a self-study or trial projects.,5
machine-learning,Molt complert,5
machine-learning,"First contact with GNU Octave (not with programming) and I finished the course and the programming exercises so the course must be well designed. The lectures were punctual and student time was expended with efficiency. Just note the audio is a bit low quality at times, I'm not native of the language and I need the subtitles (in english, as the errors in translations to my natural language makes preferable to use the english subtitles so I can compensate for the times when I cannot understand the audio). Subtitles seems automated (pardon me if they aren't) but the accuracy for english is superior.",5
machine-learning,Prof. Andrew is an awesome lecturer!,5
machine-learning,"I really enjoyed this course on Machine Learning. It has sparked my interest in data science and analysis, and I hope to continue to learn more in the months and years to come!",5
machine-learning,This course is well organized and clearly taught. I learned a lot from this course. Thanks very much!,5
machine-learning,"This course is excellent for those who want a theoretical introduction to Machine Learning and has some background with calculus. Andrew Ng makes everything looks really easy. The exercises are good because you can actually see things running, and they are not really difficult. Tutorials make them easy also. I wish the assignments were in Python although. Matlab/Octave is a programming language that you can't really deploy as an application, but they let you focus in the algorithms in instead of data structures. I now have a great idea about plenty of algorithms, know how to use them, know how to optimize them and can understand many materials online. Thanks Andrew, Tom and other people responsible for making it all available.",5
machine-learning,"Absolutely worth your time to learn basic knowledge of Machine Learning. But I do find that this course is actually a simplified version of regular ML course. So if you want to dig deeper into ML, this might not be the best choice for you. But it is definitely the best course for beginners!",5
machine-learning,"You can tell the Professor wants to help, and is truly a great communicator as to how he thinks about ML.",5
machine-learning,Awesome course.,5
machine-learning,The course is simply excellent.,5
machine-learning,one of the most enjoyable course ever!,5
machine-learning,"This course is very good!! Recommended for those of you who wants to learn about ML even from zero! Only required small knowledge of maths (differential, linear algebra, statistics) or programming. These are some of the reasons:Easy to understand explanations. Interesting motivations before starting to introduce new model. Intuitions on model give a better picture of the problem. The programming assignments are based on real machine learning problems and let you learn the real implementation of a ML algorithm.",5
machine-learning,This is a great course for me to update the knowledge of machine learning。 I hope more people can have opportunity to learn from it。,5
machine-learning,Exceptional lectures by Prof Andrew helped me in understanding the Machine Learning fundamentals.The quizzes and programming exercises are challenging enough and force you to revisit the lectures for good.I hope to implement the learning in my area of interest.,5
machine-learning,Great lessons for start learning Machine Learning concepts (and not so beginner concepts). Great materials to review during/after the course.,4
machine-learning,Good lecturer. Good balance between learning videos and practical exercises.,5
machine-learning,Nice course which gives the high level picture of ML,4
machine-learning,很不错，收益良多，感谢老师教导！,5
machine-learning,very helpful course,5
machine-learning,Excellent Course!! Thanks a lot Sir!!,5
machine-learning,"best intro for machine learning, i feel partially confident to apply these skills to real world problems, thanks Andrew!",5
machine-learning,It's a clear 5 for someone who never did ML (but has the preconditions). It's a 4.5 for someone with some knowledge that wants to catch up. Not recommended if you're not fairly well versed in linear algebra. Calculus recommended to really understand what's being talked about.,5
machine-learning,"Personally I didn´t have experience about ML. The course is didactic and helps to understand lots of concepts. Nevertheless, I strongly suggest to improve scripts since there are some issues to upload homeworks and even there is an answer within the forums, should be a good idea to fix this.",4
machine-learning,Excellent course in every way!,5
machine-learning,"Great introduction to ML. Feels like a good stepping stone in to the field and sets you up to learn from different resources. However, you are by no means an expert in Machine Learning at all once you have completed the course",5
machine-learning,"An impressive course by a very good instructor. Despite having an MS operations research degree, I really have learned a lot even on the topics that I have previously done in my course work. The assignment were very good and structured to help student understand the core concept and also implementation details. I would say in the end, Thank you very much, Andrew Ng for such a wonderful course and for coursera.",5
machine-learning,"Awesome course, thank you for all this knowledge that you've shared with us and you're tips and advices that make us more comfortable with machine learning algorithms",5
machine-learning,The course is awesome. I would like if we can include next step forwards as end of course.,5
machine-learning,"Very good teacher, very good course",5
machine-learning,Step by step description of different machine learning techniques that allow you to get concrete usage of them.,5
machine-learning,"On of the most exciting fields today - Machine Learning - has been taught so very comprehensively by Professor Ang , that this course becomes almost mandatory to complete in order to gain insight and get the basics of this field. The BEST course ever. Professor Ang had my attention to the very last lecture and this emphasizes on how brilliantly this course has been designed and taught by him. Kudos to the mentors who guided everyone through this process.",5
machine-learning,very nice overview,5
machine-learning,"After digging around in the MOOC world for a bit in search of a more current course, I came to the conclusion that this course is still the best. Reasons are it offers a solid theoretical foundation, and it doesn't use all the built-in libraries when it comes to implementing the core concepts. I feel confident that I can now tackle a more current course with a better idea of what goes on behind the hood. A truly great course!",5
machine-learning,"Really great. As a math major, some of the material early on is too slow but the pace is certainly good later on after neural networks. If you feel not challenged enough, you can always think about why something is true while Andrew describes them. And if you have enough experience of linear algebra, Andrew makes reference to many aspects of it in the course for you to think over. There may be some repetition between different sections, but that helps with drilling the important facts into you. Also, the whole course as taught at Stanford is available online with the all the mathematics put back in and so you can always go visit there if you wish.",5
machine-learning,This course was great!,5
machine-learning,Fantastic,5
machine-learning,The most clearly explained MOOC I've participated until now.,5
machine-learning,"This course is the core of machine learning, provided fundamental understanding of machine learning. Extremely useful for technical staff, executives and investors, grateful to Professor Ng.",5
machine-learning,"I was surprised by the amount I ended up learning from this course. While the course may seem a bit easy, this is a result of Professor Ng's clear and concise teaching style. This course will give you a strong foundation in machine learning — enough for you to begin to self-teach yourself new algorithms and techniques with ease, and even allow you to parse through academic papers! I am left with an accomplished feeling, and slight sadness over the fact that I will never be able to take a full university course with Professor Ng.",5
machine-learning,"Completing this course is a thrill. While I have studied this math earning my computer science degree, it's been a very long time since these memories have been of value - I'm currently in a IT Director role at a foods manufacturing company. This course is an excellent starting point on a journey to use machine learning to solve real problems. Many thanks to Andrew Ng and Coursera for this excellent course, it was a lot of fun.",5
machine-learning,"I think this course is the best entry into the concepts of ML you can find. Andrew Ng is a wonderful, passionate teacher and explains most concepts in a way that is easy to grasp. I liked the emphasis on supervised learning and taking time to explain the very foundation with linear regression, logistic regression in great detail. When you look around the internet everyone is talking about cNN, Deep Learning, GANs, ... but the truth is - you first need to get your foundation right before moving on the more advanced topics. ML is actually a lot of mathematics, stochastic - so getting initial knowledge about these topics is important. Some things in the course where not that well explained, for example Back Propagation. In general I can recommend this course to anyone who wants to START with Machine Learning and needs some orientation on the subject.",5
machine-learning,This course will help you clarify your idea about machine learning field,5
machine-learning,"Very interesting course! Don't require much math background. Love the programming tasks especially, very useful!",5
machine-learning,Great course! strongly recommended to biginners,5
machine-learning,great starting course for beginners who want to explore the ocean of machine learning .andrew sir teaching is marvellous,5
machine-learning,V,5
machine-learning,i think the course is great!,5
machine-learning,very good.,5
machine-learning,This is a great course where you can learn easily the fundamentals about machine learning.,5
machine-learning,"This is my first experience with an MOOC and I thought it was awesome and I'm sad it's over. If Professor Ng created any other ML courses I would sign up instantly. I also found it really easy and super beneficial to take the homework data sets and objectives but do them entirely in python using pre-existing scikit-learn where possible.Pros:Emphasizes practical application and does not go into to much math detail. Professor Ng is an excellent speaker and obviously a very clear thinker. You get the sense that content is carefully curated by someone who knows what is actually useful for doing ML in the real world. The data sets and the broad objectives for the HW sets are a good balance of not too messy or challenging, but enough practice that you come away feeling you could actually use some of this stuff on your own real problems.Cons:HW in matlab / octave :( I did all the homeworks in Python (mostly scikit-learn) instead. Quizzes are just mediocre, sometimes vague phrasing, sometimes quizzing you on octave syntax, sometimes too easy.",5
machine-learning,Extremely interesting while also being organized and well taught. I feel extremely prepared for any future endeavors in machine learning and that this has given me the perfect foundations for such things. Highly recommend to anybody interested in learning about machine learning.,5
machine-learning,Andrew takes the time to clearly explain the concepts. Most quizzes and programming assignments helped reinforce your understanding of these topics. I had taken a few ML courses before this but this was by far the best one I had. A must for anyone new to this topic. I wish he did a follow up of this into deep learning and so on.,5
machine-learning,Fantastic course - intuitive explanation of general concepts in ML - I am not a computer science student but this course has convinced me to enter work in which these skills can be applied. Thank-you very much Andrew!,5
machine-learning,"This was a great introduction to machine learning. I enjoyed the real world problems that were given in the practice sets. The course does an awesome job of not requiring extensive programming knowledge, and teaches you few tricks along the way. It was also a great opportunity to practice vectorization, which is a skill always worth bushing up on from time to time.",5
machine-learning,"Excellent Course, suggested to me by my manager at work. I had some interest in AI, but didn't have any real direction as to where to go or how to implement it in my current job. Now that path is much more clear, and I look forward to utilizing this machine learning knowledge in practice, both professionally and personally.",5
machine-learning,"Professor Andrew NG，thank you very very much! I have learned many machine learning theory form this course.It is so kindly to understand, and the method explained very carefully. I really enjoy it! ：）",5
machine-learning,Extremely well thought out course. Highly recommended. Could be improved by giving more involved examples and refining the course on backpropagation which have some typos and brought about a little awkwardly. But still a great course!,5
machine-learning,Very nice and complete course.,5
machine-learning,"I just finished this course and, although this was the first course I've taken on coursera, I know that not all courses will be like this one. I can tell that tons of work was put into developing this class (thank you), because all of the material was incredibly useful, presented with perfection and very easily digestible. My original intent was to not pay for the certificate, but very quickly I felt that any prospective employer should know that I have knowledge of the powerful tools I've learned from this class.",5
machine-learning,Peeeeeeeeeeeerfect!!!!!!!,5
machine-learning,特别棒,5
machine-learning,"Thank you, Andrew Ng. It was very useful course that helped me to do my first approach in ML and to understand in which direction should I develop my skills.",5
machine-learning,I am trying from last 5 days to start my enrolled course but error message is displaying Everytime. Kindly solve my problem.,1
machine-learning,"Andrew Ng is one of the best teachers out there, he made it a point to really make concepts sound simple enough for a layperson to understand, very simple explanation of concepts is what kept me going. I really liked this course.The support forums and Tim Mosher deserve a special mention - whenever I got stuck with my assignments I would look to the test scenarios available to test my coding, it really helped me to complete the course especially with the assignments.I will not say that I am a master of machine learning now, but I am definitely more equipped and with experience I will get much better using the skills and techniques that I learned in this course",5
machine-learning,Excellent course materials.,5
machine-learning,Straightforward and the homework submission process is great... very simple and streamlined :) The only recommendation for improvement is that some of the videos dwell for quite a while on very simple operations but skip over some of the more interesting or complex operations. it would be nice to see more time on proofs and less on super simple things.,5
machine-learning,A must-follow course for anyone who wants to understand the basics (and much more!) of Machine Learning.,5
machine-learning,I learned a lot from this course and especially appreciated the programming assignments. The quiz questions were thought-provoking. The mentors were super responsive and there to help learn. Couldn't have asked for a better intro to machine learning.,5
machine-learning,"easy to understand, good for beginners.",5
machine-learning,"Took some off from work in December and could complete it in 10 days. it was awesome experience specially the coding exercises. Hats off to #Andrew and #coursera for the course, I think even for people who are working in industry this should help to refresh the concepts. Looking forward to more advanced and recognized course from Andrew and Stanford and Coursera.",5
machine-learning,Very good machine learning course for beginners!,5
machine-learning,"It's my very first online course, and I'm so lucky to go through it with Andrew. This course covers almost everything you need to know if you want to start your adventure in machine learning, highly recommended!!",5

machine-learning,I think it's a great Class,5
machine-learning,It is really a good lesson!,5
machine-learning,"Too easy ... but otherwise good! The programming assignments do a bit too much of the work for you, but solve some pretty interesting practical problems.",4
machine-learning,"Excellent course, Dr. Ng is such a magnificent teacher, the way he explains the topics is splendid and he make them look easy even when they are not. Thank you so much for this course, for all your time and effort.",5
machine-learning,excellent content and great beginners course,5
machine-learning,"My first machine learning course, and it was clear and detailled.Thank you!",5
machine-learning,"Excellent course about Machine Learning!! Very well structured, comprehensive and well explained. Thank you for your teaching!!",5
machine-learning,"As a newcomer to the topic, I found the course extremely helpful and insightful. Although, it would be better if the assignment problems and projects are extended (i.e. more assignment problems) and are less spoon fed.",4
machine-learning,"A fantastic opportunity to get a global overview of one the most exciting topics of data science.Lectures by Mr Andrew Ng are well structured, perfectly declined in both illustrating the need behind each development and in rigorously explaining its logic. He drives you through a step by step path and always helps in understanding the overall context with clear examples. Each video is stopped now and by a not graded quiz aimed to check you are perfectly in line with the concepts. Grades are obtained through the questionnaires (five questions each time, you need to get no less than four correct answers out of them) and a programming exercise in Octave/Matlab. Especially in order to well deal the programming exercises, the discussion forum and the kind availability of the course mentors are a great resource!In conclusion a seriously challenging course, that will take lot of your time but it's definitely worth! Many thanks Coursera and really thanks and congratulations Mr Ng.",5
machine-learning,A very good tutor. A very good class. Thank you for your teaching. It's very useful to my research.,5
machine-learning,Very clear introduction to ML,5
machine-learning,"Exceptionally good presentation of topics, assignments reinforce the concepts taught and support on the forum is very good. Enjoyed this class thoroughly.",5
machine-learning,Excellent course to get started on machine learning. The forums are very helpful. Looking forward to an advanced treatment of this course in the future with a Capstone perhaps.,5
machine-learning,"This course is designed for beginner-level learners. Through this course, you will somehow have a clear picture of what's going on in machine learning (including a bit of deep learning e.g. neural network). It doesn't require much high level of math knowledge to complete this course, and the matlab practice is definitely worthwhile to give it a try. You're also more than welcomed to examine the codes written not for the exercise, and that surely helps you better understand how Octave or matlab works. Overall speaking, it is a good course and navigates you through the fancy world of machine learning. Good thanks to Prof. Andrew Ng for providing this fabulous course.",5
machine-learning,This is a must for anybody interested in Machine Learning!,5
machine-learning,"A good popular-level introduction to basic, classical concepts of machine learning. Provides intuitions without going into any mathematical depth or serious programming.",4
machine-learning,Great to getting started in Machine Learning!,5
machine-learning,"Amazing course. If want to learn ML, you should start completing this course.",5
machine-learning,This course made a very complex topic very digestible. Thank you Andrew and Coursera :D,5

machine-learning,"Nice intro to ML I felt the course was a bit easy, but the course is really nice, Thanks to Prof. Ng",5
machine-learning,"Wonderful course !! I have been trying to gain practical machine learning algorithms but some online materials were too mathematical and others were too introductory. The hands on labs helped me gain the concrete understanding of concepts and confidence that I could build a simple ML system by my self in the future. Also, practical information during the class will save me tons of my hours if I will build any ML applications in the future. I really appreciated this class and it was a happy time. I really thank Prof. Ng with all my heart !!! Thank you very much..",5
machine-learning,Excellent! I have learning too much. I respect Andrew Ng.,5

machine-learning,awesome!,5
machine-learning,very nice course which explains the basic theoretical concepts and implementation ideas,4
machine-learning,很好的课程，特别是编程练习，对我帮助很大，谢谢,5
machine-learning,very good to go through classes and reviews,5
machine-learning,Fantastic course and systematic view on the machine learning domain. Appreciate the broad yet detailed knowledge. Also the programming assignments are great to help me understand deeply and practically. Great instructor!!! Highly recommended!,5
machine-learning,"Challenging, interesting and overall a great experience. Totally worth it even if you do not have a big background on Linear Algebra or basic Calculus.",5
machine-learning,"Be aware that if you start this course, you will spend a lot of time with learning. The instructor, Andrew is amazing! He explains extremely complex things in an easy-to-understand, enjoyable manner. The content is well organized and pretty wide covering many aspects of machine learning. If you are new in ML, and want to understand it, this is your course, money well spent.",5
machine-learning,Highly recommended for everyone who wants to pursuing career in Machine Learning field!,5
machine-learning,"It was a great course, the videos are good Andrew NG was great i had a lot of fun.I started with no knowledge in this area and i feel i ended up with a good understanding of how these sort of systems work.One thing i would say it could help improving are the programming assignments which were mostly already put together by the ""Starter code"" not much was left for me to do. I felt they were not hard enough and were not a good a preparation for me to build complex systems on my own as they could of been.",5
machine-learning,Tough but totally worth it,5
machine-learning,"Very, very good lecturer. I learned a lot!",5
machine-learning,great class !it has Opened the door to the new world for me.I love machine learning,5
machine-learning,A solid foundation course for anyone who wishes to pursue Machine learning.,5
machine-learning,The only thing I can say about this course is THE BEST COURSE I have ever taken online. Very well structured and taught and very lucky to be one of the students.,5
machine-learning,very useful for my career and nice to new learners.,5
machine-learning,Exceptionally well prepared and beautifully executed.The lectures are interesting and to the point. The programming assignments are both helpful and student-friendly.Andrew is both an expert and a great teacher. Not a commonly found combination.,5
machine-learning,I like the course! Professor Andrew Ng is very detailed and didactic. The course has a nice pace and the programming excercises was very useful to solodify the learned contents. I only missed some guidance to continue the study on more advanced subjects.,5
machine-learning,"Coming from an Applied Maths background, I found this course rather boring the first three weeks. However, after that it was _very_ interesting and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in the field.",5
machine-learning,这门课程是机器学习的入门课，对我来说很有帮助。通过这门课程的学习，我学到了机器学习的基础知识，对以后的学习和研究起到了促进作用，我以后还会继续学习，深入研究。,5
machine-learning,Excellent introduction to machine learning. Very helpful while working together with machine learners,5
machine-learning,great!!! I learned a lot !!! I recommend,5
machine-learning,This course is the best introductory course i've ever seen for this field. It showed me what we can do with machine learning .,5
machine-learning,课程逻辑性非常强，非常适合对机器学习宏观上的理解，且每个部分的细节也很详细。,5
machine-learning,The best course I have ever taken.Designed to understand easily and the assignments is fairly moderate with sufficient resource.This is the best course to come to the world of ML.,5
machine-learning,"Great content and explanations. Exercises guided hands-on efforts through all of the major algorithms and concepts, including very useful tools such as training rate analysis, cost and gradient descent verification, etc. Exercises were well structured to focus on key concepts - i.e. didn't have to spend a lot of time sweating the details of loading datasets, plotting results, ... The code I take away is an excellent foundation with which to explore other datasets with confidence.I was originally a bit dubious about Octave-based exercises based on some reviews I'd read from others (who were more R or python-centric), but I found it to be an excellent choice given the linear algebra underpinnings of all of the algorithms and exercises.The linear algebra foundation and vectorization implementations I think better prepare me in approaching large scale ML problems leveraging existing / emerging linear algebra and ML libraries.Thanks again!",5
machine-learning,It is well done course!,5
machine-learning,Great course with directions from Andrew about what to start with in Machine learning.A more comprehensive course with pattern recognition in general could however be devised.,4
machine-learning,So excellent course! Thanks Professor Ag and others.,5
machine-learning,"Brilliant videos and readings. Clear and thorough teaching, with the perfect balance between reinforcement and fast progress.",5
machine-learning,It's amazing. The best course I have!,5
machine-learning,"Amazing course, and amazing lecturer, Thanks to NG!!",5
machine-learning,Very respectful instructor and wonderful course.,5
machine-learning,"Excellent course, highly recommended!",5
machine-learning,"Comprehensive, and well explained course. A great way to begin learning ML for those interested.",5
machine-learning,"The Machine Learning course taught by Professor Ng is a good way to survey a variety of the commonly used techniques in the field. Though I had been exposed to algorithms like k-means, SVM, PCA, and regression before, it was good to see a unified treatment of all the subjects.The video lectures are good. In the early weeks I felt a bit overwhelmed by new information, but by the end of the session I was feeling that the lectures were being stretched out. In particular, I started noticing the professor would repeat every point 2 or 3 times. That may be a good style in general, but I found it time-wasting.The quizzes were good, but a few of the questions here and there were phrased poorly, in an ambiguous manner that made it hard to understand what exactly was being asked. One questioned used vocabulary we hadn't been introduced to. (Sorry, I don't remember in which unit this happened - it wasn't a big deal at the time.)I enjoyed the programming assignments the most and, quite frankly, lost interest at the end when there were no more to be done. Most of them were challenging - at least if you avoided using the tutorials which really take you through every step. I found the SVM programming assignment thin - we really didn't do anything there except multiply a couple matrices.I have mixed feelings about the transcripts that accompany the videos. On the one hand, they are very helpful for skipping ahead when one sees a certain idea repeated 3 or 4 times. On the other hand, they are obviously automatically generated and riddled with errors. For a machine learning course, this is particularly ironic.",5
machine-learning,Very good intro course to Machine Learning – it gives you the intuition behind all algorithms from the very beginning. Definitely recommend!,5
machine-learning,"Very good. Wish it went deeper into the math behind the algorithms, but wasn't the goal of this course. Thanks!",5
machine-learning,"An older course but definitely worth completing, it covers a wide variety of topics cleanly and with great intuitive explanations as well as practical advice for real world applications.",5
machine-learning,"Very helpful course on fundamental elements of machine learning, and Andrew does a great job articulating ideas without overwhelming math. Great experience learning machine learning on Coursera!",5
machine-learning,Andrew is a great teacher. I loved how he broke down everything into simple easily consumable information. I came into this course with a relatively good understanding of Linear Algebra and Statistics so it made things a lot more easier. Highly recommend the course to anyone looking to get some hands on experience with Machine Learning.,5
machine-learning,"I really enjoyed the course and found it an excellent introduction to machine learning. There is a good balance between theory and practice, with programming assignments most weeks. One minor area of improvement would be to have more optional lectures on the mathematics behind the algorithms, particularly for backpropagation and PCA. There seem to many people taking the course with at least some engineering / mathematics background and even a sketch of a proof can give more insight into how an algorithm works. This can of course be found elsewhere, but Prof Ng explains this stuff so well!",5
machine-learning,"A wonderful course on the fascinating and wide field of Machine Learning, this class has been eye opening and has done a wonderful job at sparking a deeper interest in this vast, vast field. As Prof. Ng says in the last video, I hope to build something cool and useful for people with what I've picked up here. The course has done a very good job at balancing the level of depth along with the number of topics. Barring a few topics in the end such as recommender systems which I feel was a topic too complex but had to be brushed through, I genuinely enjoyed every other one. Thank you for this course!",5
machine-learning,"I heard about this course from an uncle of mine. I somewhat hesitant and reluctant to do this course fearing it's difficulty level. But once I started it, things were greatly simplified due to the great course content as well as the superb teaching of Professor Andrew Ng. I believe that the programming assignments could be made more difficult as in us having to do everything from loading the datasets to plotting the learning curves apart from applying the learning algorithms.",5

When it comes to the example assignments though, I prefer the hands on approach of the Udemy course Machine Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science. I guess I just do not like Octave somehow and prefer the Python approach coming from an Embedded/Programming background. Taking both the courses side by side is just perfect for getting started with Machine Learning and covers both theoretical and practical aspects for starters like me. Anyways hats off to Mr. Andrew for this course. Thank you.",4

machine-learning,非常棒的课程，感谢Andrew老师的辛勤工作。,5
machine-learning,Great course! Clear and practical.,5
machine-learning,"Amazing introductory course in Machine Learning. Dr. Ng is knowledgeable, clear, and inspirational.This course not only dug into theoretical modelling, but it gives the student the opportunity to be hands on and also apply classroom learning to real life applications.For myself who had basic programming and linear algebra backgrounds, the course at times do take effort and time. However, with that being said, I felt like I learned substantially more than I did compared to a regular classroom and was definitely worth the effort. Even if you do not finish in one term, your progress will carry onto the next term.",5

machine-learning,"Really well explained and accessible, could even be a bit more complex or at least more detailed concerning theoretical guarantees of machine learning at some points.",4
machine-learning,Perfect course. Very clear. Learn a lot from this course and the mentor.,5
machine-learning,"This course in an excellent introduction to supervised and unsupervised machine learning. It doesn't only tell you which algorithms exist and how to implement them, but also gives lots of advice about how to solve machine learning problems in practice.",5
machine-learning,One of the most informative courses that I have undertaken recently. Truly an eye opener. Theory explained with some real life application so you can easily make sense as to what you will be able to do with the knowledge you acquire.,5
machine-learning,This is a great introduction to an topic which has a lot of practical application. I found it challenging but rewarding.,4
machine-learning,"This has been an invaluable introduction to machine learning and I'd highly recommend anyone who's curious about the subject to take this course. Andrew made the material relatively easy to follow coming from a MechE background and now I feel much more knowledgeable on the topic. I'm really glad I took this course. Stick through it and really do the programming assignments and you'll get this stuff, no matter how difficult it may seem at first.",5
machine-learning,"I would definitely recommend this course! I was very impressed by the quality of the lectures. Professor Ng uses the medium very well. He's easy to follow and the content is solid.The assignments were also good. They provide a ton of scaffolding, so you rarely have to write a lot of code, but if you never used Matlab before (like me) and it's been awhile since you've taken linear algebra (also true for me), then ""thinking in terms of vectorization"" takes a bit of getting used to. I'm really happy that I've been exposed to it, though, and it's pretty impressive how much computation you can express in one or two lines of Matlab.I only had to use the forums once at the beginning to figure out why I couldn't submit assignments. (It turned out that my version of Octave was too new for what the assignments had been tested with.) Once I got that sorted out, I never had to go back there for help, which I thought was a good sign that the assignments were clear and had been through sufficient testing by the staff.It's certainly a bit of a time commitment. I would probably budget at least 5 hours per week. I took a lot of notes, so I paused/rewound the videos a bunch, so it took longer for me to ""watch"" the videos than the advertised time.Again, the assignments were often not that much code, and I think they started to take me less time as I progressed through the course as I got more familiar with Octave and the style of the assignments. They aren't there to trick you or separate the wheat from the chaff: they're really there to reinforce the concepts from lecture and have you write some code yourself so you have some chance of writing your own code for your own project machine learning project one day.If anything, the assignments provide much more help than I expected. That is, if this were an in-person course where I could go to office hours or whatever if I got stuck, I would expect the assignments to provide less scaffolding and to force you to struggle quite a bit on your own more. (Maybe I just have bad flashbacks to undergrad or something.)",5
machine-learning,"Beyond just telling you ""here are a bunch of algorithms, go use them"", Prof Ng provides a lot of information on how and when to apply them, how to tune them, and how to see whether or not they are working at all!",5
machine-learning,"I found the course a very useful (re)introduction to Machine Learning. In my case my goal was to bring myself up to date after last studying the field in the early 1990s. The course did that very well. I particularly liked the programming assignments, and the autograder worked very well. This helped ensure I fully understood the material.",5
machine-learning,"The lecturer is very good. The course is not very insightful and on the surface. It is business oriented, it doesn't deal with interesting and challenging academic problems.",2
machine-learning,It's a very clear and easy course for new student involved into machine learning !,5
machine-learning,"This is a fantastic course! While the content is reasonably technical, it is taught in such a way as to make it accessible to a wide audience. The Teaching is top notch and the material is communicated in a way that is not only engaging but concise and easy to follow. I have already implemented some of the leanings from this course in my work as a geologist which has led to some significant improvements and findings . I would highly recommend this course to!",5
machine-learning,very nice course. What I liked most is the practical advise on how to apply the concepts to real world problems and avoid usual pitfalls. The exercises and quiz are well thought out and they help drive in the concepts.,5

machine-learning,No final project,4
machine-learning,This course is really AMAZING...I really recommend to take this course. The teacher is very clear and outstanding in explaining concepts. The practical exercises are very instructive.,5
machine-learning,"Fairly good videos explaining the material, probably worth 4 starts. However, the written support material should be improved. IMHO the video should supplement the written material, i.e. it should be possible to learn the material only by reading. This is not the case, so frequent pausing of videos and making lots of notes is needed if one wants to commit this course to long-term memory.",2

machine-learning,"All over the course, the effort put into making Machine Learning's technical details understandable by (almost) everyone is absolutely notable. Professor Ng explains with very remarkable clarity; his pleasant attitude greatly helped me follow the lessons and complete the tests on schedule. Also, the choice of coding in Matlab is key to enabling you to focus on the Maching Learning algorithms, while avoiding to lose time debugging other lower level programming languages. The course is fairly introductory and obviously the math has been kept as basic as possible, so I would strongly suggest this course as a first approach to the subject.",5

machine-learning,"Andrew Ng is great lecturer! He is very clear and the lectures are well organized. It was a unique experience to learn from him the concepts of machine learnings. THANK YO, Andrew!",5
machine-learning,A great review. Andrew gives very clear yet detailed analysis about how to think about machine learning problems. The details and fundamentals of the most popular learning algorithms are taught; however I think the most valuable pieces of information are shown when Andrew teaches how to evaluate and fix learning algorithms that aren't behaving as expected. A great introduction to machine learning; the course also teaches the necessary linear algebra and matlab/octave skills needed to implement these algorithms.,5
machine-learning,Great course with well-done labs and lots of content.,5
machine-learning,"This course was a very useful overview of machine learning. It did not go too in-depth which could potentially disappoint some students, but it did a great job at introducing a complex and wide topic.",4
machine-learning,"thanks for Andrew Ng that give me a clear slight about machine learning, and through this course I gain a well achievement, the knowledge taught by professor Ng shows a wisdom way to me. I think I will inspired much by the content of this course when I design a machine learning system or deep learning system.thank you for your concretely and clearly guidance that makes me insist to learning this course until end.you are the best teacher I have never met before, the implicit way that you teach makes me want to be a better man likes you.",5
machine-learning,"Great course to get into machine learning. The explanations are clear, the pace is not high and the programming exercises are well constructed and helpful. The lecturer in some cases makes reference to somewhat more advanced concepts that may not be central in these course but that can be useful for some of the audience. Perhaps I'd like that the lecturer make the audience aware of the connections of machine learning with other disciplines and on the fact that machine learning borrows many concepts and methods from other areas (e.g., statistics and optimization). All in all, it is a course that I will recommend to anyone that wants to get introduced to machine learning and, in general, to know a number of techniques to actually address and solve real-life problems.",5
machine-learning,"A real pleasure to learn Machine Learning from Andrew Ng, clear and stimulating lessons. Thanks!",5
machine-learning,Excellent course for professionals working in other fields. The assignments strike a good balance between illustrating the concepts and remaining light-weight enough that it is manageable with other activities.,5

Thank you professor for teaching me and now more knowledgeable about machine learning and can hopefully make use of this in some of my own research projects.",5
machine-learning,Simple and accessible introduction to Machine Learning for people without strong Maths and IT background. Can become quite slow and boring (almost irritating) if you come from an engineering or technical background (some videos could have been summarised in half of the time).,3
machine-learning,one of the best courses i have ever had in coursera,5
machine-learning,Cours très accessible (niveau premier cycle scientifique) et très didactique. Exercices de programmation tous très intéressants. On quitte ce cours avec le sentiment de pouvoir développer un projet d'apprentissage automatique en toute autonomie !,5
machine-learning,"Great course, very well suited for beginners like me that want to learn about machine learning and make my own applications using machine learning. There are some mistakes in the explanation of the materials, but overall the explanation are thorough, clear, and accurate",5

machine-learning,A very great course!,5
machine-learning,Thank you for a great course. Andrew Ng makes complicated machine learning topics easy to understand.,5
machine-learning,"This course was amazing in many different ways:1. I really learned a lot about how machine learning works (at least for the algorithms covered in the course). And I'm really keen to continue learning.2. Learning tools and methods: anyone could just read about ML and algorithms, but the way the course is focusing on exercises really helps assimilate the content3. A lot of effort goes into providing support to the students. I'm very thankful to the staff who are VERY responsive on the forums. They also provide a lot of test cases and other help to better understand how to complete the exercicesI recently left my job to focus on personal development and am doing a lot of online courses right now. This course by far the best one I did so far. I'm really glad I took the time to do it. And looking forward to learning more on the topicThanks again!",5
machine-learning,谢谢带我入门,5
machine-learning,"Really interesting course, clear and well done. My only concern are the program assignments: I think they are well done and structured, but the effort required is more focused on linear algebra than on machine learning.",5
machine-learning,The course has helped me a lot in terms of understanding the basics of how machine learning algorithms work and how can i use it .Andrew Ng is a very good teacher and he explains all the concepts in a very simple way.,5
machine-learning,Very interesting - the quality of the videos can seriously be improved though. Already with little effort by editing away the duplicate parts.,4
machine-learning,One of the best courses I have taken online/offline,5
machine-learning,It is a quite good lesson for machine learning!,5

machine-learning,Amazing style of teaching.. very impressed with Mr. Andrew Ng... Overall a very good course.. recommended to all Machine Learning aspirants..,4
machine-learning,I recommend this course a lot to people who want to start learning ML.,5
machine-learning,"I gained a solid conceptual understanding of Machine Learning, its terms, problems, and solutions. But I consistently felt unprepared for applying it in Octave.The audio is poor and frustrating, which the course addresses in the first week by essentially saying, ""deal with it"". Also, the instructor has no idea what ""intuition"" means, but uses it incessantly. It's a small nag, but it builds up over 11 weeks.",3
machine-learning,Great course. Very well organized and covered a lot of the topics in machine learning. But it is mainly for the people has none/little experience with ML. Not an advanced course.,5
machine-learning,"Great intro to ML concepts. Takes about 5 hours a week to do it right, but it's worthwhile.",5
machine-learning,Excellent class on Machine Learning. Thanks for offering it!,5
machine-learning,Amazing course and lucid teaching.,5
machine-learning,Very easy to understand!,5
machine-learning,"Andrew Ng is a terrific teacher who managed to excite both beginners and intermediate learners alike.

machine-learning,Great course with proper segmentation of learning blocks,5
machine-learning,"Out of all the courses I have done on Coursera, Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course is head and shoulders above the rest. He paces himself well, and explains very clearly, both for those who learn better with formulas as well as those who learn better with intuition if you don't get the numbers. A lot of the examples used are from real life and not just hypothetical ones which spice up the lessons. A lot of effort has been put into this, and it shows. Definitely one of the best courses out there.",5
machine-learning,very good for machine learning junior,5
machine-learning,"This course gives a very useful overview of what machine learning is and provides the tools to dive into more rigorous material. The explanations are always easy to understand and assume no knowledge on machine learning or the topics related to it, and slowly introduces the most important parts to get a good understanding of the course",5
machine-learning,"Very good , but lack of mathmatical proof .",4
machine-learning,"Awesome course! Rich information to help me understand how things work, not just how to use them. Highly recommended!",5
machine-learning,"Really clear and informative, i have really enjoyed being part of this class. Best of luck in the future.",5
machine-learning,cours excellent sur les premières parties. La fin est plus un survol rapide qu'un véritable cours.,5
machine-learning,Very nice course! It's quite suitable for beginners to learn something about the machine learning.,5
machine-learning,This is a really wonderful course.Gratitude to Andrew Ng for his efforts.,5
machine-learning,Learnt the basics of machine learning. Looking forward to learn more.,3
machine-learning,"Excellent course!Fundamental concepts are taught but in a way that is intuitive.I like the quizzes because each question forces me to dig deeper into my understanding.Very innovative way to do the exercises, they are challenging but fun!",5
machine-learning,Great teaching methods. Enjoyed learning the basics and algorithms used in the machine learning field. It definitely helped me speak the machine learning language taking this course. Thanks Andrew.,5
machine-learning,"Like the way instructor kept it simple yet informative, deliberately avoids unnecessary terminology. Quizzes and assignments help in understanding the ideas put forth in lectures. Would have been even better if we had a final project longer/tougher than assignments.",4
machine-learning,"Very good course overall, but it does need some cleaning up. Lots of small typos and errata have been documented in both the lectures and the homework assignments. There seems to often be inconsistent row/column formatting of X and/or theta in the homeworks versus the lecture notes which creates unnecessary confusion. Although it is possible for the student to browse around multiple areas to piece together the puzzle, given that the course has been around for several years I feel that there should be a cleanup and reconsolidation of things to save students time. But yeah... given that you can take this course for free... it's pretty badass :)",4
machine-learning,Professor Andrew Ng gave the lectures in a very clear way and makes the course even more interesting. The only thing I wanna complain is the voice quality in the video. The volume is not that high and the audio is kinda coarse.,5
machine-learning,best course on ml,5
machine-learning,Exercises are really very usefult to et hands on experience and to become autonomous after the course,5
machine-learning,帮我过了各个面试，很多理解还是不够深入，打算在刷一遍～,5
machine-learning,"This course is very useful for learning machine learning , i appreciate for taking this class by Coursera , and i would be grateful to Andrew NG !",5
machine-learning,"This is the first course that I have completed via Coursera. The videos/presentation were easy to follow (I liked the function to view the videos at 1.5 x) and there was a lot of guidance as to how to proceed with the programming assignments. Programming is not one of my strong skills, but if you follow the tutorials that the mentors have set up and use the test cases, it was very doable. I do think that students need to search for similar questions in the forums more. I found that so many people ask the same questions that have already been asked and answered before. The mentors have been very patient with everyone.",5
machine-learning,"It is easy to understand, so it is very helpful for those who don't have much Machine Learning knowledge.Although I have finished this course, there is still a long way to go in Machine Learning.",5
machine-learning,Good for learning fundamentals of ML.,5
machine-learning,老师真的太棒了，讲得很好很容易接受，本来以为机器学习很神秘很复杂，老师的讲解让我能够懂其中原理，能够自己动手操作，让我能够顺利地把整个课程上完。非常感谢Andrew老师的精彩课程，深入浅出的讲解，非常感谢！,5

machine-learning,The pace works for me. The course materials are what I am looking for.,5
machine-learning,"Extremely well done course! Every video carefully explains the part of the concept being introduced. Whether its the derivation of a concrete formula, such as gradient descent, or a qualitative concept, such as the vector support machines, the tutor's explanations are always very clear and concise. I like that a lot of different ideas are covered, and even though I have a mathematical background, this course doesnt require it, since the most mathematical parts are left to the interested reader while the focus lies on the applications. A very beginner friendly course, all you need is some basic calculus and probability theory. Also , if its too easy for you: the notes of the actual Stanford University Course (!!) can be found in the materials section of the course, so you can ""play the course on hard mode"", too. That Stanford version is a lot more mathematical and difficult. All in all a very very good course, and I'm happy I tried it. I would probably do every course done by this tutor, he is that good of a lecturer. Coming from a maths and stats lecturer, btw.",5
machine-learning,Very good overview of the topic of machine learning.,5
machine-learning,"Awesome course!Thank you, Andrew, for this journey!I highly recommend to all beginners this course!",5
machine-learning,"Quite useful for beginners in AI, even if you don't have much maths knowledge. It is not only theoretical but also practical, giving you great starting points for developing your future own projects.",5
machine-learning,thanks！,5
machine-learning,"This is a basic course that will provide good fundamentals in ML. If you are already a student with advanced degree in Mathematics/Engg or a professional with decade of experience might find the class a bit slow. However, it was well worth it.",4
machine-learning,非常感谢Andrew老师的授课，作为业界的大牛课程讲授的十分清晰明了，这一个月以来的学习让我真正对机器学习有了一个全新的认识！,5
machine-learning,"Very well made and interesting overview of machine learning. It won't make you an expert, but it touches on some very important aspects and tricks that may make you work much easier. Math in this course is not hard and even if you don't have any background, you will probably do well, because it's well explained (but not in detail, just basics).Only cons that I can think of are mostly personal and not that significant in terms of the course subject. Sometimes explanations drag on a bit too long for my liking. And I would prefer if assignments were issued in python, because right now there are a lot of tools made for that language that make prototyping and writing ML solutions pretty fast and easy.",5
machine-learning,"This course is a great introduction to the world of machine learning. The instructor is very thorough about each topic. I believe that I can now take what I have learned in this class and start applying the knowledge to real world problems. I do find sometimes that the requirements for the programming assignments can be a bit vague, but the forms help to close the gaps.",5
machine-learning,Excellent Course!!!,5
machine-learning,"The course was excellent, but I have to say that the exercises are a bit boring because all we have to do is code the same things again and again, instead of practicing different aspects of machine learning. This is only my humble opinion, and for a great course like this we can demand a little more. This course put the rod very high to the other courses. Thank you for sharing your knowledge with us.",5
machine-learning,Great choice of course contents,5
machine-learning,The content is somewhat easy. Adding more in-depth analysis and concepts would be really helpful.,4
machine-learning,"Great course. It helped me getting real insights in Machine Learning algorithms. The videos were very clear and fun to watch, the excercises were not always easy but very rewarding once completed and the help from the mentor and other students on the forum was very helpfull. I recommend this course to anyone who is seriously interested in Machine Learning.",5
machine-learning,Excellent course! Covers the basics of Machine Learning deeply enough for some one who wants to do real work on it. Very good examples and exercises. I definitely recommend the course.,5
machine-learning,One of the best Online courses I've ever taken. Provides a solid introduction to Machine Learning while being very comprehensive. And the programming exercises do help a lot in understanding the concepts presented in the lectures.,5
machine-learning,"This was a really interesting and useful course! The instructor was good at explaining the concepts. The assignments were useful; Octave was a good choice and a language i had never used before. Some of the early lesson videos had audio problems, most could probably be solved with an automatic volume normalizer. Having a slightly slower pace option without switching sections would have been nice. Looking forward to doing another related course!",5
machine-learning,"From the absolut beginner i was, this course leveled up my knowledge.I am recommend strongly.",5
machine-learning,Very impressive ！,5
machine-learning,"Thank you for having this course. I enjoyed it thoroughly, the materials were well prepared and the programming exercises were excellent. I would be really happy to be a part of more of such courses from Stanford. Awesome work guys!",5

machine-learning,I think the topic choices are spot on. Also Andrew is a very teacher (especially at 1.5 audio speed),5
machine-learning,honestly this is one of the best courses I've had about any subject matter. I spent 6 years going to college for engineering and this puts many of the courses I took to shame. Great work here.,5
machine-learning,Andrew Ng sir is awesome :),5
machine-learning,"Very simple intro. to techniques that exist in machine learning. The content of each week could be improved by extending to include proofs/derivations and making calculus a pre-req. But this does make the course very accessible, which is a big advantage.",5
machine-learning,It is not an easy course without some knowledge of matrix calculation and intermediate math. But it's quite worth to learn what's the machine learning is.,5
machine-learning,"It is an awesome course to start with, for whoever want to start a career or research in Machine learning domain. Amazing clarity in all the lectures, concept oriented quizzes and a really good set of assignments make this course a must watch for all who aspire to be in machine learning or related fields.",5
machine-learning,I never know online learning can let me learn as much as in classroom. Definitely the best experience I ever had and will take other Coursera course again and strongly recommended!,5
machine-learning,Andrew Ng is like a true Samurai Master on ML. Lucid explanations coupled with complex assignments. Evolved a lot from this course. Thanks a lot !!,5
machine-learning,非常喜欢这门课 讲解非常细致 作业非常恰当 能感受到作者真的是在用心做这门课的视频和作业。强烈推荐！,5
machine-learning,"I'm excited to learn new concepts and know the logic/match that goes behind all predictive analytics, classification process, recommendation system, OCR, and the photo adjustment process etc. Looking forward to use the skills",5
machine-learning,this will definetly give you an idea on what machine learningn is. but you need to learn a lot more if you want to be good at it. but this is some good material to start with.,4

machine-learning,very good. I apreciated the teaching,5
machine-learning,Great Course :D,5
machine-learning,"I would like to thank Prof. Ng for the understandable introduction into Machine Learning World. I learned insights of several commonly used algorithms in ML. Several good hints and tips are really good for dealing in programming in real world. Totally agree with the approach to use Octave, as it focus on the math (and what is happening in the algorithm) rather than getting lost in the tool chains of programming. The intuition about what is happening (how it works) really stands out in comparison to other course available (for not getting lost in the wild...).",5

machine-learning,great course个,5
machine-learning,"Great class. Much better than most I have attended in person. Excellent instruction, excellent resources, excellent programming exercises, excellent support in the forums, especially by Tom Mosher. Video is a much better medium than live lectures because of the flexibility, shorter segments, ability to stop and study something before going on, and ability to repeat when necessary. Great practice in vectorization. Excellent introductions to the necessary elements of ancillary topics. Bought the certificate. We live in a golden age for learning. Getting this kind of instruction would not have been possible for someone in my situation 30 years ago. I am grateful and looking forward to whatever I learn next.Took this course to develop skills to work on artificial intelligence and other projects. One previous project described in article at http://www.kdnuggets.com/news/2007/n09/7i.htmlVery satisfied. I have not been able to stop talking about how good this class is since I began taking it, and will continue to recommend it as the first step for anyone serious about the topic.",5

Love from India :)",5
machine-learning,Great course to get an idea about Machine learning and its various algorithm,5
machine-learning,Overall great introduction course to ML. Covers a lot of fundamental concepts without getting heavy on the calculus and linear algebra. The theme stays very practical and he teaches you just enough theory so that you can feel comfortable implementing the solutions.,5
machine-learning,The content is great. Course was engaging and highly informative.,4
machine-learning,"A lot of content was taught in a very well organized and time saving manner. From teaching point of view, the course was outstanding. But, most of the tasks in assignments were already implemented which was not beneficial from learning point of view. Hence, 4/5.",4
machine-learning,"Andrew Ng is an absurdly talented instructor who makes complicated subjects simple and fun to learn. He has an unmistakable focus on practical application and understanding of machine learning, and helps build up a skillset that can immediately be applied in your career. This has easily been the most valuable course I've ever taken and I can't be grateful enough.",5
machine-learning,An excellent course.,5
machine-learning,pretty nice course!!!,5
machine-learning,very good lessons with well designed hands on practices,5
machine-learning,An amazing course with all the basic concepts of Machine Learning taught in a way almost anyone can understand. All the quizzes and programming exercises were challenging and made me understand the concepts even better. A great course overall. Definitely worth the time and money.,5
machine-learning,"Amazing course !First I have taken this course to understand the big picture of what is ML.After this excellent course provided by Professor Ng, the clarity of the concepts explained, I now want to do a shift in my career and go deeper in ML.Thanks Professor !Thanks to Coursera too.I do not if you change the world, but at least, you have changed my world !",5
machine-learning,"Wonderful Course, Thank you ,Ng~!",5
machine-learning,"I would say this course is fantastic. Only the expert who truly understand something can tell that thing in such a easy and clear and organized way. Prog Ng is that expert.This course is easy for people who even donot have any programming experience. Videos are cut into appropriate 5~15 min, making it even possible for fragmentary time. Furthermore, there is no complex mathematics, only the important equations and formulas are represented. So dont be afraid of it.",5
machine-learning,Very good course.,5
machine-learning,"Practical and easy to understand,Very nice. Thanks for the teacher's lecture.",5
machine-learning,A landmark of online teaching. Wisely designed learning curve backed up with excellent programming exercises and practical advice. If you want to get yourself familiar with basics of machine learning theory and algorithms - look no further.,5
machine-learning,"This is an extremely well taught course. I recommend taking it after learning Linear Algebra. ""The Analytics Edge"" through MITx (EdX.org) complements this course nicely. It would have been nice if the programming assignments had been a little more challenging.As a great followup course, I recommend Prof. Ng's same course as taught at Stanford: https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS229",5
machine-learning,Genial,5
machine-learning,This course structured very well for a beginner. It makes it easy to understand the concepts.,5
machine-learning,A great pleasure to learn more deeply what is behind the libraries : algorithmes and how to choose where to put my efforts. Thank you,5
machine-learning,It was really good . I intend to take more such courses in my future.,5
machine-learning,Very well structured and great learning. My special thanks to Prof Andrew and the entire team; This will help me shape up remaining years of of professional life for sure.,5
machine-learning,"Excellent course! There are many small mistakes throughout, but these are addressed in the errata provided. In addition, a few mentors were constantly providing helpful feedback, even to questions covered elsewhere (such as the errata). I came to the course with a strong statistics background, so one o the very helpful things for me was learning the machine learning terminology for things I was already familiar with from statistics. One final point - the course is structured so that you are improving your general programming skills as you proceed. You begin by doing the simple for-loop implementation but will later see/do the more efficient vectorization. This is incredibly helpful for those who do not come with a solid basis in linear algebra / matrix algebra, since you do the intuitive/""easy"" version first but later develop more efficient coding which you now understand because you did the intuitive/""easy"" version earlier in the course.",5
machine-learning,"Just amazing, thanks to you I was able to write my first implementations of ML algorithms and apply them to real data. https://github.com/praisethemoon/whale-core.I'm very thankful!",5
machine-learning,I liked very much this course!!!,5

machine-learning,Best course to get started and know thoroughly the Machine learning basics,5
machine-learning,Good teaching and task!,5
machine-learning,"i learnt something, but i can never able to use it. i have no idea, anyway, ML is just still having the real application for the command development field in the business now. for example like me, working in software development firm and medicare company before, none of them really applied the machine learning theory. although, they have certain value if applied, for example i saw many of them trying to convert their business to big data business, however they never use the big data correctly, assuming applied a machine learning in order to predict the potential customer response of a single product, it looks fun. anyway, fact is fact, currently the business is still a relatively low technical level business. everything is report, linear, and simple ( i will not say unfortunately, at least i have time to write this comment when i am actually working)",5
machine-learning,Superb course for any beginner in ML!,5
machine-learning,This course is just awesome. It presents a wide range of terms and applications in a very simple way. The Matlab assignments and the online submission are also a great privilege of this course.,5
machine-learning,"couldn't be better! It's not just useful for machine learning, but also for random signal study! Cause we also need to manipulate many matrix calculation in signal estimation and prediction. The ways are similar and the teacher is awesome for explaining mathematical stuffs very clearly.",5
machine-learning,"Immense course. Comprehensive subject material, well paced, at the right level. Andrew is a great teacher. Can't recommend highly enough.",5
machine-learning,"The course provides a good overview of machine learning methods. I would enjoy it more if it was a bit more friendly to those who actually know some math, as it could provide better understaning and insight about why and not how the methods actually work. I would also appreciate if programming exercices were a bit more complete and language agnostic. Otherwise I really like the style of professor Ng. Thanks for the course.",4
machine-learning,The most explanatory MOOC I have ever sat! Keep up the good work!! Thank you for passing me all this WORTHFULL knowledge!,5

Most importantly, it persuaded me how powerful the concepts of machine learning are and how important it is to understand them. I would definitely recommend it!",5
machine-learning,课程设计和讲解示例都非常好,5
machine-learning,"Prof. Ng is such a good teacher that he explains things in a proper way to make you understand.He has a profound understanding of the details and derivations behind the knowledge and conclusions. If you have a relative background, you would have a chance to think about the knowledge in a deep way. If not, you can still get the main idea and be able to use it, and you know what is lack and where to learn it.Overall the lecture notes and videos, the quiz and assignments are all good, full of thought about how to make students follow the course and understand better, as well as exercising with real applications.I didn't realize that the machine learning course was the first one on Coursera and Prof. Ng is the founder of this wonderful platform, until toward the end of the course. No wonder the quality of this course is so good. I learned a lot and would recommend it to anyone with a good math or physics background and want to learn Machine Learning seriously.",5

machine-learning,It was well designed and very well depicted course. The faculty is superb and that's why the course has been so exciting. Really appreciate.,5
machine-learning,Super intro course! Thanks to Andrew!,5
machine-learning,"I thought, looking at the syllabus that the course will be somewhat easy for me with previous Econometrics training at graduate level. It turned up to be on par with the pace I could take it (about recommended time 1-2 hours video, 3 hours programming a week, sometimes more for exercises), and provided quite a few new insights and accessible, very intuitive introduction to many methods, algorithms, and approaches in Machine Learning. While initially I thought it was unfortunate for Andrew to have glossed so many times over details (while explicitly apologizing), I realize that that is inevitable choice between breadth and depth. At the end I would agree with the balance chosen.For my taste, I still miss the approach of mainstream Econometrics of treating every model as hypothesis (which is in the name of function in this class, but not more than that) but then testing it with the data at hand, and having a chance at rejecting it at certain level of statistical significance -- I believe not having this misses the significant chunk of scientific approach. I realize the goal is automation of much of human work in this process, but I still do not feel the balance is found. Miss any formal statistical assessment of the goodness of fit, like R-squared. At the same time I realize that I may still need to reconcile some mainstream training with new techniques.Would definitely recommend this class a really good introduction with good balance of depth and breadth to get you on the fast lane to learning the Machine Learning. Not sure if that makes you an expert -- but gives you a really good, sizable first step in that direction.",4
machine-learning,g,5
machine-learning,"Amazing course completely worth every second spent on it. I was enrolled in a similar subject in my University and I decided to unsubscribe from it and do some other stuff to get the credits as it involved so much time due to its really long practices (mainly due to documentation, dealing with Python peculiarities and collaborating with really junior or low performing students) that it was impossible for me to get the time to properly work on it, as I'm also working and doing some other subjects.With this course here I have been able to learn the same concepts and work with them in practice too with much less overhead, focusing on the most important parts and concepts for each topic.Most importantly, I this has served me as an introduction to the Self Driving Car Engineering nanodegree that I hope to join soon at Udacity!",5
machine-learning,Thank you so much for the incredibly useful course! I feel like I have a strong foundational understanding for machine learning and I'm ready to start looking at applying my knowledge with higher-level libraries like TensorFlow.,5

However, in the end the difficulty and depth of the course is great. For the committed student, you'll walk away with a lot of practical knowledge (if you take notes.",4
machine-learning,Excellent Course.. Awesome lecture videos and slides,5
machine-learning,"Very well-taught class. The weeks of classes has been organized properly so that each topic will build on top of the previous topics. Professor Andrew Ng dissects every important aspect of the topic and does not involve other topics that may not be important to learn. Instead, he states that some algorithms are already usable and optimised by other fields of specialisation and students learning this class does not need to dive deep in order to do Machine Learning.",5
machine-learning,"Professor Ng does an amazing job teaching complex concepts in layman's terms. He is patient, polite and encouraging...yes I got all those impressions from the videos ! You will come away with not just a list of key algorithms used in the industry, but an actual understanding of how these algorithms work. Knowing this, you can intelligently select the right algorithm to be used under different real-world circumstances. Finally, the support system to help you succeed is great; the Mentors on the site pitched in to offer help when I was stuck. I definitely recommend this course on Machine Learning and look forward to taking many additional courses on Coursera, especially from Professor Ng.",5

machine-learning,"Simply a great course! It really gives you the tools to create intelligent algorithms.Although, I would not recommend it to those with no foundation of calculus, linear algebra or programming. You can attempt to do this course, but the course load will be at least twice as much, because you need to figure out those three things as well. (I myself majored in Chemical Engineering and did a minor Programming)",5

machine-learning,"Andrew, a big 'thank you' for teaching this class! Even though I DON'T consider me as an (real) expert in ML now, I got a thorough understanding of many many topics of ML. Prepared with an arsenal of algorithms and a lot of great advice I feel ready for take-off. The course has been teached in a perfect order, explaining not only the mathematical underpinnings (luckily not in depth) but focusing on the intuitions, rationale and use-cases behind the different algorithms. The many given examples (lecture and ready-to-run-code in exercise) have been very motivating and inspiring.Some exercises turned out to be a bit time-consuming when trying to implement them in vectorized form. The catchiest part has been installing Octave (4.0.3) on OSX. I strongly recommend to go with the virtualbox/vagrant/xquartz based installation (see resources). So that's it. Thank you again!",5
machine-learning,Excellent Course. Andrew Ng explains the concepts very well. I had a lot of fun with the exercises!,5
machine-learning,Really great course. Thanks Andrew for a new level of knowledge and great teaching.,5

machine-learning,"The basics of Machine Learning explained in an easy to understand way. For people like me who are unfamiliar with Statistics the need arises from time to time to research certain things on your own. I would recommend just a little bit of familiarity with Calculus (i.e. derivatives) in order to better understand things, but certainly not necessary to make progress.Professor Andrew does a great job at explaining the concepts, and the programming assignments are very interesting and challenging.The course does suffer from BAD English subtitling, but not exactly something that should put you off.This course is a great way to get started in Machine Learning, and paves the way for more advanced learning in the future.",5
machine-learning,I liked this course,5
machine-learning,awesome class! Professor Ng is one of my favorite professors.,5
machine-learning,"The lectures are very well spoken and easy to understand.Programming assignments are kind of hard without really understanding the math and algorithm behind, and a working solution may just end up being a shocking few lines of code. Challenging but fun and very helpful for understanding the mechanism underneath.",5
machine-learning,This could be huge for me!,5
machine-learning,"This Course about machine learning was really amazing, throughout the 11 weeks of this course I gained a good knowledge in this field of science in both theoretical and practical sense.

machine-learning,Nice initiation to Machine Learning covering the main algorithms,5
machine-learning,"The course, although simplistic, teaches the essential basics of machine learning with solid examples and projects.",4
machine-learning,"I would give 4.5 stars if I could. First, the positives: I got a great overview of many machine learning topics and learned a lot in general, the professor is excellent, and the programming assignments have plenty of resources to expand your knowledge beyond the core requirements. However, in later weeks, as the assignments grew more complex, I became a monkey. In the earlier weeks there was a focus on the fundamentals, which while very frustrating, are necessary to cement your skills. Later weeks failed to keep this up and emphasized increasingly isolated problems where it wasn't necessary to understand the big picture, and you can succeed (still with frustration) using blind guessing and transposing matrices. The problem with this method is that real life does not always have an assured solution. That said, if you are self motivated, there are plenty of resources to address this gap, and if you want to learn machine learning for its own sake (and not just to get a certificate), I strongly recommend you take this course.",4
machine-learning,The course is comprehensive and inspiring. Highly recommended!,5
machine-learning,Very good introduction to Machine Learning. Thanks Prof. Andrew Ng,5
machine-learning,Great course which teaches the fundamentals of machine learning. It makes me want to learn even more and go out there and apply all the knowledge given. Hope there will be a part II for this course with more advanced topics.Many thanks to Andrew Ng!,5

I was sceptical that Machine Learning on 'big data' would simply be another area of applied statistics.This course EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATION IN BUCKET LOADS!It applies modern computing power to large data sets to draw inferences with direct real-World application. PCA and dimensionality reduction was what attracted me to this course (via a recommendation in the 'Gut Check: Exploring Your Microbiome' course) and I have gained great insights in this area. In the past I used spreadsheets; now I will use Octave (or other languages) to perform analysis via scripts.A huge thank you to Andrew Ng.",5

machine-learning,"A course without almost any prerequisite knowledge requirements. While this makes it an excellent introductory course in Machine Learning and at the same time still applicable there are a few drawbacks. Your actual understanding of ML will be pretty shallow. Programming examples do to a certain extent facilitate understanding of the algorithms in use, but it's somewhat hard translating to real world use due to fairly heavy amount of abstraction and ""code-hiding"". Still, I would recommend this course as a starter course for ML as it will greatly enhance your understanding for ML in general and where to go next.",4

machine-learning,"Great hand-on practical knowledge, ready-to-be-applied. Totally worth the time spent.",5
machine-learning,"It's a very fundamental machine learning class. After finishing this class, I have gotten the overview structure of machine learning and it promotes me to learn more and deeper on machine learning. Also, Prof. Ng is humorous and has a great skill to teach. I like his teaching style.",5
machine-learning,A great (and must) introduction on Machine Learning.,5
machine-learning,Good introduction without too much math.,5
machine-learning,Great course. A progressive discovery of the maths inner to the learning algorithms. This course gives that insight many ML practitioners don't have and is so important for making real use cases work.,5
machine-learning,Great course! Many thanks!,5
machine-learning,"It's unbelievable that I can learn more sitting miles away than by sitting in an actual class. And the sole reason for that is the tremendous work Prof. Ng, the mentors and all others related to the course have put in in bringing this course online. Videos are extremely well explained and the programming assignments are just the right amount of challenging that leave a sense of satisfaction upon completion. It's a wonderful and unique attribute for a course to have its students attached to it. This one managed to achieve just that. Thanks!",5

machine-learning,Good starting point for learning ML!,5
machine-learning,"Fantastic course, would thoroughly recommend to anyone with even a passing interest in machine learning.",5
machine-learning,"It would be easy to rate the course with anything below 5 stars for it being not enough formal and academic; for explicitly not requiring prior knowledge of basic calculus and algebra; for using MATLAB instead of actual industry standards.But that would probably be unfair, because Andrew Ng's course is a brilliant introduction to Machine Learning. Soft, tolerant approach helps newbies to overcome initial feeling of being overwhelmed by ML algorithms and learn them while playing with lots of code provided with the course.It is also definitely worth mentioning that prof. Ng not only explains problem settings and algorithms that are suited to solve them, but also shares many experience-driven hints for actually applying ML in practice.All in all, this course will not make you a Data Scientist, but it definitely will help you grasp the basics and prepare you for more demanding education; or even for simpler actual practical tasks!",5
machine-learning,Challenging but very informative.,5
machine-learning,Teaches you basics of Machine Learning.If you have no idea of Machine learning then this course is for you.,5
machine-learning,Great overview of most promizing ML techniques. Just enough math to be able to use the knowledge but not too much to make the course heavy. Stimulating. Oriented to people that want to be operative on ML rahter than understand,4
machine-learning,This course is not just another online course. You enjoy doing it and will learn a lot. Go for it,5
machine-learning,Very helpful and it is a good intuition for machine learning!!!Recommend!!,5

machine-learning,这是一门能锻炼思维和动手能力的课程，具有很高的学习价值，并且老师的授课深入浅出，易于学习。,5
machine-learning,This was a great course. The coding assignments were very instructive. The only possible improvements I see at this point are: 1) getting rid of the very wordy multiple choice questions with more than one correct answer. I can see how the idea is to make cheating hard but I didn't particularly enjoy those. 2) Having a textbook to see all technical details in one place rather than jumping around between the contents of different weeks. Thank you!,4
machine-learning,really useful,5
machine-learning,"Loved the course! Very clear lectures. The programming assignments are just the right level of difficulty to reinforce the lectures without making me feel lost. Only minus is that the course feels a bit dated, with lots of known errata and no mention of more recent developments such as convolutional or recurrent neural networks. Would love to see an updated version released!",5
machine-learning,Awesome and well vulgarizated !!! THXXXXXXXX,5
machine-learning,One of the best course I have seen in my career. Its very good course to start understand from basics to the advance level.,5
machine-learning,"Good, and you almost never need to make a comment in the discussion groups as most issues have been pre-discussed.",5
machine-learning,"I think the course is a good primer for anyone who wants to get into ML or for anyone who needs revisiting the basics of ML. I would say for anyone with a mathematical background it might feel not enough, but it's a perfect start. I used to remind myself of a lot of things I learned and to find out about new concepts such as neural networks. Great",5
machine-learning,"Really nice course, but the quizzes kind of take much from the examples presented in the lectures, so it seems to me like learning by heart would be somehow enough to get the grades. Comprehension could be more emphasized in the tests. Said another way, I found the quizzes to be rather easy (some questions were tricky, but many seemed to me rather obvious).",4
machine-learning,"Thank you Andrew, course mentors and all those who made this valuable information available.",5
machine-learning,Excellent excellent course to get started in Machine Learning domain.,5

machine-learning,wonderful,5
machine-learning,It's a very useful course.,5
machine-learning,This is by far the best online learning course. I learned so much from Prof Andrew Ng. I really appreciate it. Could have been better if we wrote all the codes from scratch but that would have taken longer time. Much informative. Next is to learn python and the sckit-learn libraries. I prefer Octave and MAtlab because you actually see and understand the algorithm and the basics of it. its not widely used though but very powerful. Thanks again.,5
machine-learning,The course was very interesting and useful for my project.,5
machine-learning,"The course developed by Andrew Ng is quite interesting, going to the essentials in order student get the big picture and the essential tools for building the backbone of future ML applications. Of course, being confident with mathematics principles and notations will be helpful but most of the time, it's not an issue if you have the minimal knowledge. What it lacks on Coursera is the next stage of this course where we could investigate further the technologies presented but in more technical way. Maybe we might see that in the future...Regarding course supports (videos, forums ...), they are of good quality and the fact Andrew used them by drawing on slides helps to have a better understanding. We could notice that there are few minor errors (eg: a ""j"" index which becomes ""i"" in J(theta) writing) and I think the technical slides on Back propagation could be improved if a dedicated slide to used mathematical notations / definitions. Sometimes, there are some errors which could induce some confusions. But these minors errors don't hide the impressive work done by Andrew.Regarding assessments, quizzes could be tricky if you don't got the ""spirit"" (not an exam habit in France) and coding exercises are well structured in order the student will focus on the core modules of the lesson and not on information flow. These exercises are inspiring if you're interesting in teaching and inspiring for Data Scientist Apprentices if you investigate the utils functions developed to support the exercise.Many thanks for this great course and I hope my two cents will help other people to attend itBruno",5
machine-learning,"About me: I studied computer science in Dortmund, Germany in the 90ies. I recommend this course to everyone who wants to have a very good understanding of machine learning. A little bit of advice, if you have never learned linear algebra on a university level, you should at least try to get a basic understanding of it before starting this course. I was happy that I remembered stuff, learning it from scratch in 1 or 2 weeks would be difficult, I assume.+:* Mathematical basics of machine learning are very well explained* Andrew Ng is a very good professor, he explains the topic very well and thoroughly* It is not limited by using a special framework or language* The support in the forums, and the transcription of the talks, and all the material that is given to you is really excellent.-:* I would be happy if the programming exercises would be a bit more fun, currently it feels like translating / transforming math formulas into octave, which is fine, but not very fun. Having said that I am only in week 4, perhaps this will happen later* some text questions in the multiple choice quizzes require a precise understanding of the english language, especially in regards to math, I am not a native speaker, so these questions feel especially hard for me",5
machine-learning,The course content was systematically organized with increasing complex algorithms covered as the weeks progressed. Prof Ng's enthusiasm for the subject also made the course enjoyable. Thank you so much.,5

machine-learning,very good course for those who are new in this area.,5
machine-learning,"Apparently, Andrew Ng is determined to downgrade the handicap score of this course to make it more available to a larger audience, some times at expense of rigorousness. I agree with most of the concessions, except the assumption that even calculus is not strictly pre-required. On the contrary, I believe that calculus, matrix, and probabilisitic thinking should be required for modern engineer to be qualified to work on big-data. Or, we might have conceded too much of the battleground.",4
machine-learning,"Great course! The scope was just right, giving a broad enough introduction to spark interest and give the tools to further delve into machine learning applications.

machine-learning,I enjoyed the way Andrew explains the whole stuff. Thanks for being such a great tutor.,5
machine-learning,Overall a great course. But the assignments could be more challenging.,4
machine-learning,"This course has absolutely made me a confident ML practitioner. I went from knowing very little about a few ML algorithms to being able to confidently implement many of them, and easily learn to implement others from outside resources. Beyond having mastered the algorithms themselves, I now feel equipped to effectively diagnose and debug problems in my own ML projects.I have learned to plot the learning curves in order to find the most effective way to improve my algorithm, and I have used this in real life already! It's a very empowering feeling. Machine Learning used to feel like magic, but now it's a clear and simple tool to add to my toolbelt.Thank you so much Professor Ng for a marvelous course! I learned so much, it feels like I'm in college. Thanks!!!",5
machine-learning,Immense Learning. Turned me from a beginner to an expert practitioner. A big Fan of Andrew NG for his simplicity and lucid teaching style.,5

machine-learning,"Sir, its very well designed and easily to understand. Thank you",5
machine-learning,"I enjoyed this course, its balanced, easy enough for a general software programmer to start off into this math world. One thing I would wish for is a lesson exclusively talking about all the available options for any production needs, and talking about the different jargon that is used out there in the ML world and how we can relate it back to the jargon used in this course.For example, when I try to use R, I get to know that I need not code to start with and I can use off-the-shelf packages like 'caret' to quickly try different models and compare their performance. But the real trouble I felt is when I tried to analyse their results, as I see too many new words and representations that are used, like Kappa, Specificity, etc.,. I wished these kind of very generic things were also quickly covered in this course.",5
machine-learning,"I took this course seriously and worked all the way till the last assignment. As per my experience and understanding the course contents are quite dense, but the lucid and succinct presentation made it quite comprehensible and interesting. I was amazed to find how well the concepts were formulated in a suitable mathematical modelling. I wholeheartedly thank Prof. Ng and the support stuffs for this wonderful course.",5

You will developing your own neural networks from the scratch. Below are the pros and not pros (i won't call it cons) that i experienced.PROs :Gets onto topics right away.Information about practical implementationDoable. Not too difficult and not downright easy. You have to put effort if you do not have backgroud in undergraduate mathematics to understand the concepts.Prof. Andrew Ng. - He has knack of explaining something very complex in a very easy manner. Also, he justifies if he is not going to explain somethingAssignments evaluation and practical scenarios.Not PROs :Very High Level : This course does NOT go in detail to explain the derivations and mathematics behind machine learning course. I think its OK and that is what makes the course doable. I find it really hard to accept a formula if the reasons are not known and hence, sometimes our only task was to learn the formula. For example : in SVMs.What Next :It is just a feedback. I think at the end of course, course team should guide students, what do to next. May be which course can be a good follow up course for this.So, at the end, i just want to thanks Coursera team, Stanford Team, mentors, peers and Prof. Andrew Ng for spreading this knowledge for free. It is really helping people like me to study something not readily available in good quality in reach. Hopefully, i will also be able to give back to community some time soon.",5
machine-learning,Great course!The lectures were really well constructed and really well delivered.The exercises were useful too!,5
machine-learning,"good, there is nothing to explan except that",5
machine-learning,"Excelent course, I totally enjoy it",5
machine-learning,"Thank you Andrew for the course. It's excellent.I Propose to start with the end first. I.e.: Instead of going through the details of Linear, logistics, NN, we start with the what is Training data, CV and test. Then we go to high Bias and High variance, and how to practically address real problems.At the second part, we go to the details and mathematics of different models in 2 levels: 1 level same as provided, the second level is optional to cover the math completely for those who wants know more.Thank you again, It was just great. Now I am one step closer in working in the field that I like.",5
machine-learning,Buen Curso!,5
machine-learning,"Excellent course! Good depth of coverage of concepts. However, it would be better to have additional resources and problem-solving opportunities, either within the course or outside (which course participants could make use of).",5
machine-learning,The course is really well designed. The assigments are very useful to fully capture the theoretical part.Andrew Ng is a very very good professor. It is really clear he is really comfortable with all these subjects and as an extraordinary ability to connect all the topics covered in the course as well as translating complicated concepts into a clear mental picture.,5
machine-learning,This is the perfect course even for high school beginners like me. I find the career I want through this class.,5

machine-learning,perfect!,5
machine-learning,"Comprehensive but also insightful. I learn this course together with other learning material like ""Statistical learning"". It turns out this course teaches me practical thing to do something, while another course gives me just some conceptual idea what the thing is.",5
machine-learning,"Completed the course, but not the tests. I got the understanding I need to proceed. Thanks Andrew Ng!!",5
machine-learning,"A great introduction to Machine Learning techniques. Because learners do not build assignments from the ground up, do not expect to be adept at implementing any of the tools taught here. Figuring out what had already been done required about 40% of my time solving the exercises. Some errors in the provided code are not corrected, so check the errata!",4
machine-learning,"Excellent course, Excellent teacher!",5
machine-learning,"This was an excellent introductory course to the world of Machine Learning. I think that after the course you are going to be able to read any paper in the area and grasp at least some details of it. Andrew is one of a kind teacher, very intuitive and easy to follow. This was the kickstart I was needing to completely dive myself into the world of ML. Completely recommended!",5

machine-learning,Good material for beginers,5
machine-learning,Excelent course.,5
machine-learning,"I am a big advocate of MOOCs as it definitely democratize education. Only challenge with MOOCs is that over time they become too monotonous and one looses out the interest. I've tried to take up few machine learning courses over past few years, but never got past first few steps. I am still in the going through the course, but so far it has been an outstanding experience. Not only the content is engaging, it has been really simplified. If you're new to Machine learning, I can't recommend this highly enough.",5

machine-learning,"Excellent Course!!!! Andrew Ng. is truly a great lecturer who turns complicated ML problems into easy-to-understand examples, even for a person without CS background like me.",5
machine-learning,"As stated famously stated by Einstein, ""Everything Should Be Made as Simple as Possible, But Not Simpler"", Andrew Ng and team has made this course simpler for anyone with minimal mathematical knowledge and programming skills to learn machine learning in short time. I am sure this gives a solid foundation to build upon. Thanks a ton to Andrew and team!",5
machine-learning,"Despite I guess the course has a pretty good coverage of the ML basics, it is definitely just an introductive class. In particular I was surprised by the low quality of the material.The following are my notes and suggestions:-- I found the lectures highly redundant, with many unnecessary repetitions-- using a vector notation (like an arrow or a simple line on top of the letters) throughout the course would have make formulas much more readable-- too much hand writing on the slides while talking: a better set of slides with blocks of text shown at the right moment would be much smoother and readable-- very, very poor video editing (many times it's clear some parts of the videos were meant to be cut!!)-- the desire to create a format suitable for people with a scarce algebra preparation lead to use not the appropriate terminology, which would be more correct and easier to understand. Just realize that ML is basically applied math, and without a good math knowledge it is almost pointless to approach the subject",3
machine-learning,I am a super fan of the Andrew NG and very grateful for his contribution for ML area.Good luck to his adventure in Baidu.,5
machine-learning,"Fantastic course! Prof Andrew shared the various concepts in a clear, succinct and easy to understand manner. The various relevant and practical examples also helped to reinforce my learning. Definitely well worth the time and effort!",5

machine-learning,Great course !!!!,5
machine-learning,"Heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Ng and the entire coursera team on pulling off such a great introductory course. Honestly, machine learning is such a vast topic, that every nook and cranny of the internet has some opinion or the other on its methods. It can get pretty daunting for a beginner. This course is a perfect balance of theory and practice. It doesn't get too ""mathy"", nor does it get too dumbed down on it. The basic ideas, their implementations are discussed thoroughly, and Dr. Ng himself is such a smooth lecturer. A section on what to do after finishing this course would be helpful, as there are so many domains of machine learning, that it can get pretty confusing to decide. Also, I found the assignment tutorials a bit vague. Multiple times, I happened to scratch my head trying to figure what exactly the assignment in asking me to do. Clearer explanations of what to do in the assignments would be great. All in all, a wonderful course. Thanks a ton!",4
machine-learning,"Very very intuitive and insightful course, i got a lot out of it, thanks Andrew and Coursera team.",5
machine-learning,One of the best courses I ever take!,5

machine-learning,Good for me.,5
machine-learning,Very nice and useful course on the basics of machine learning.,5
machine-learning,"Professor didn't do a good job on explaining the theory. He moves too fast. This should improve so that student who has less/weak knowledge of Math can pass the quiz. If you are not a Math student, don't take this class. I was hoping to learn about how to program to control the machine/robot but it turns out that this is more focusing on the theory instead. I would recommend to take another course of ML/Big Data from UCI instead.",1
machine-learning,Very nice structure of lectures. Interesting and useful practical tasks. There is only one sad thing - sometimes answer in test are can't be matched exactly without assumptions. Very good practical examples.,5
machine-learning,"Implementation orientated course with little mathematical details with lot of intuitive explanations. Also, deals with practical issues involved while using the algorithms. The best part is Prof. Ng shares his experiences and way of thinking throughout this course which is extremely enlightening. Overall, I would suggest a beginner in Machine Learning to take up this course as their first step.",5

machine-learning,Very Good! It's quite helpful for me as a Machine Learning guideline. Applications are interesting.,5
machine-learning,This is a nice course for getting started with machine learning and AI. I used this course for learning side by side with my college. At college they generally teach nothing much about AI just some theories of important concepts like neural networks and things like that. But this course made me understand everything. And the teaching methodology is very nice. It keeps students in track. The professor makes learning fun maybe that's the reason why am enjoying this course,5
machine-learning,Good and easy to understand,5
machine-learning,"I just want to extend my deep appreciation for Coursera team and Andrew Ng who have been working so hard to make the course incredibly rewarding. Please keep up the great work.Son Nguyen,Singapore",5
machine-learning,A very good introduction to the subject that moves at a good pace but doesn't make such big jumps that it is difficult to follow. Andrew Ng presents the subject clearly and gives some good insights.One of the most valuable aspects of the course are the assignments where actual code is developed and worked upon. The code provided gives a good starting point for people to move forward and develop their own applications as they progress further.I would like to thank Professor Ng very much for producing this course and making it available so easily. Also to the people working with him to mentor those participating on the course.The course has very much wet my appetite for machine learning and I am now keen to pursue the subject further both through developing my own applications and learning more about the subject,5

machine-learning,Great Course for beginners!,4
machine-learning,"very clear, effective and full of information, thank you.",5
machine-learning,讲得非常好，适合入门，数学知识涉及的比较少。,5
machine-learning,When I started this class I had only the fuzziest notions about what machine learning really is. By the end I had a solid understanding both of the underlying mathematical principles used in machine learning and of the practical considerations for applying it to real world problems. I really enjoyed Professor Ng's lectures and the course mentors are very knowledgeable and helpful. The programming exercises did a lot to reinforce the week's material. The time estimates are pretty good too which made it easier for me to organize my schedule and get all the work done. I'm very happy with the course and looking forward to using machine learning in my projects.,5
machine-learning,"This is a great course for developing your patience and a lot of knowledge. You will enjoy this course if you put in best effort, hard work and dedication. This is a great course to expand your knowledge about computer science and venture into a new aspect of computers.",5
machine-learning,"The course is good for initial steps in machine learning. The pace is relatively slow.I don't like that some sections are stated ""as too complicated"" and the formulas are just provided without a proof(in particular the support vector machine lecture). I doubt anyone will implement this from scratch, but IMHO just providing the formula is almost the same as not mentioning the algorithm at all. I am familiar with the related material so it was not a great deal to me but I guess if you don't know linear algebra this could be frustrating.There are some glitches in the lectures - sentences repeating. There are also some minor mistakes that the lecturer does(everyone does some I guess).The last bit I did not like is that students are forced to use octave and that parts of the lectures focus on that.",4
machine-learning,"Very nice, understandable lecturer giving an all-rounded intro to Machine Learning, while giving enough details for you to start a capstone project of your own. Recommended!",5
machine-learning,A must for someone wanting to start with Machine Learning.,5
machine-learning,Très excellent,5
machine-learning,Very nice course well adapted to students from any place in the world. Keeps you engrossed and focused during all 11 weeks. Materials are well structured and explain the topic completely clearly. Assignments are interesting and enthralling.,5
machine-learning,The course was awesome and the way it was taught was even better.,5
machine-learning,Excellent course!Very interesting with great instructor,5
machine-learning,Thank you for a great course!I really learned a great deal during those weeks!,5
machine-learning,"Excellent presentation of the material, providing not only the mathematical concepts but the context in which they are used. Definitely taught as well as my best classes at university, and far above the worst. I believe it could only benefit from some earlier discussion on vectorization vs. using loops, but I enjoyed the challenge of solving that on my own. Thank you for offering this!",5
machine-learning,"This is one great course which is exciting throughout all the weeks of content. You'll be thorough with almost all basic concepts of machine learning by the end. But programming assignments are needed to be submitted using matlab or octave, Introducing python would be a great update to this.",5

machine-learning,The best course to start doing ML!,5
machine-learning,"Wonderful introductory-level Machine Learning Course. It teaches you the very basics of machine learning, but if you want to go further, probably you need to pursue a master/phD degree and delve in the world of ml.",5
machine-learning,"An outstanding course. It starts out a bit hard, especially if you aren't very familiar with Matlab/Octave as I wasn't. But the challenge is worth it. I feel much more confident in my understanding of many of these algorithms. I think, though, that after week 7, the class gets a bit too easy and routine, especially with the programming assignments. I was looking for something either more in-depth and/or challenging. I also would have liked to see topics like reinforcement learning covered, or further advice about how to design machine learning pipelines.Professor Ng is an excellent teacher, and I thank him for making this great course!",5
machine-learning,Very well taught lectures! Professor Ng has an excellent didactic.,5
machine-learning,"It's a very difficult course and some parts are quite abstract for me, luckily Professor Ng explains everything very clearly which helps me to understand quite well. Thank you so much Professor Ng.",5

machine-learning,这门课程非常好，需要认真的学习。,5
machine-learning,"Tried hard to complete this course around a year ago, but pressures of work etc. meant I only made it around two-thirds through. However and despite this, I found the course to be amazingly well instructed with clear explanations and examples. Andrew Ng's skill and enthusiasm for teaching shines through. His deep knowledge of the subject matter is evident. The course is well structured with step-by-step lessons. Despite my failure to make it all the way through I found the course enormously useful at work as it re-enforced some things I already knew about and helped fill in the gaps in my knowledge regarding the variety of machine learning approaches. My ambition is have another go at finishing this course once I completed another related course!",5
machine-learning,Good intro,4
machine-learning,This course gives me a good ML knowledge with easy explanation.,5
machine-learning,"This is a great opportunity for every one with a basic knowledge of programming and math to jump in the wonder world of the Machine Learning.

Every thing is very well prepared by the course organizers to have a great experience when exploring the ""Machine Learning"".Hope you enjoy this course as well!",5
machine-learning,"Excellent - both content and delivery wise. Thanks very much... More than certifying the course, I believe I've learned immensely from this ""not so easy"" course, and was able to related quite a lot to some of the work I did on ANNs (MLP) back in the 90s.",4
machine-learning,Amazing course. Through my first week now and it's a really good course,5
machine-learning,Its a fabulous course specially for beginners.Thank you Professor Andrew Ng..!!!,5
machine-learning,Very well as introduction and more to the matter.,4
machine-learning,Very clear and well taught lessons. Had a very good time learning many new concepts :),5
machine-learning,Thank you Ng,5
machine-learning,非常容易理解。,5
machine-learning,I am thoroughly satisfied with my learning experience and the way in which Andrew Ng handles the course. The onus given to explaining the mathematical reason behind every concept is noteworthy. I would highly recommend this course to my friends.,5
machine-learning,This is a great course. The instructor Andrew Ng carries you through the material in easy to understand lectures that are divided by topic in perfectly timed video sessions with individual quizzes during each video that help you gauge how well you have understood and grasped the topic discussed in the lesson. This prepares you to take the graded quizzes and complete the programming projects.The programming projects have great documentation that enhance the learning experience and illustrate applications of the material just learned.I greatly recommend this course!,5
machine-learning,"This course is simply amazing, it treats advanced mathematical models for ML in a way that make them accessible to anyone regardless the background. Also Andrew is really clear and you can see the passion for ML shining through his face as he speaks, and this is a great added value that motivates you as nothing else!The only thing that I may want to suggest is to concentrate the programming assignment more on testing the learning algorithms on real world problems rather than on implementation details (as there are tons of libraries implementing learning algorithms out there)Thanks Andrew for the service you provided to the Coursera community, hope to meet you someday!",5
machine-learning,Prof. Andrew Ng is the best faculty for Machine Learning. He made the course very simple and covered most of the topics from its foundation. The examples he illustrated made it understandable.,5
machine-learning,"Great course for an introduction into Machine Learning. Implementing the algorithms oneself is kind of unrealistic as there are plenty of existing libraries that do it for you but it's good for learning. I would have liked some more real world examples e.g. using caret, glm, random forest etc in R.",5
machine-learning,One of the most impressive courses I ever had. Dr. Ng assumed that every student was the beginner and explained those complex theory and method in plain words. Strongly recommended this course and I will surely broadcast among my friends and colleagues.,5
machine-learning,A great takeoff to machine learning with small but efficient steps!,4
machine-learning,Extremely well explained videos. Prof Andrew Ng is great!,5
machine-learning,This course was extremely well taught and professor Andrew Ng made sure that we grasp each and every concept by giving us proper examples.,5
machine-learning,Interesting and comprehensive course to reccommend.,5
machine-learning,"Ng's practical approach addresses complex topics giving you the right intuitions and just enough to get you on track to actually go about doing useful things, and also showing enough of a ""map"" to get you to dig deeper in the right locations. Thanks Ng and the great mentors of course, especially Tom and Paul.",5
machine-learning,"Great course, great teaching.If more stuff is introduced, that would be even better.",4
machine-learning,Very well presented and beautifully explained course. Anyone at any level can understand and find the course very useful.,5

machine-learning,"This is a very interesting and practical course, even for free!",5
machine-learning,Nice Course,5
machine-learning,"Exciting course!Very useful for those who would like to improve their computation skills, Python applications in scientific simulations and etc.This course were recommended to me as a one of the best introduction course to the Machine Learning; therefore, I recommend it to you too.",5
machine-learning,"Andrew Ng的课程深入浅出, 强烈推荐机器学习初学者学习!",5
machine-learning,"I really appreciate your effort and help. Thankyou Teacher Andrew, Mentor Paul and Tom!",5
machine-learning,Well explained right from the basics :) Thank you,5
machine-learning,Well designed course to provide an overview of the field..,5
machine-learning,"Thank you guys. Course is very good. I'm now really excited to work on project that use Machine Learning. Hope I find one quite soon. Providing the course for free is a really awesome thing to do. I appreciate that, but there seems to be fee charged for certification after completing the course :(.",4
machine-learning,My only problem with this course is that it did not contain reinforcement learning. Please add this topic to future sessions.,5
machine-learning,"Got the math muscles working again - great insights for a first ML class, great mentor support!",5
machine-learning,"Amazing, Andrew explains really well each topic, and I think the most important part of this course is the debugging the algorithms, understanding where and how you can improve the algorithm that you are working on.",5
machine-learning,"Gently-paced and reasonable in terms of course work load, even for a busy person. This course greatly demystified machine learning for me.Alvin's lectures are friendly and easy to follow, and progress smoothly from one point of interest to the next, always taking time to briefly recap on precursor topics that were previously discussed.I really appreciate how the assignments focus on the core algorithms and their implementation. Ancillary implementation steps and a scaffolding for testing and viewing the results are already given for the learner to use, play with, and go back and reference for educational purposes if need be, for refreshing on use of tools such as plotting methods. The way the assignments are structured, putting emphasis on filling in the gaps with implementation of the important algorithms, makes completing assignments a very satisfying and fulfilling experience. I feared I would get caught up in preliminary steps, i.e. getting plots to display correctly or cleaning up the data, but that's all taken care of so that one can focus on practicing the techniques most relevant to the topic and algorithms.I only wish there were more assignments to complete, both to cover more of the course's material and to have more chances to practice algorithm prototyping in Octave/Matlab.",5
machine-learning,"clear explanation, useful course, have enough knowledge to become an ML engineer",5
machine-learning,"Great overview of several ML concepts and topics. Being a python fan I was skeptical in taking a course where the assignments were restricted to using octave. Yet, I was pleasantly surprised by how every lecture and assignment set was explained via basic linear algebra, and was impressed by the speed and efficiency of octave's framework of working with matrices. I also a little surprised that Random Forests and Decision tree based algos were not covered in the course.",5
machine-learning,"Great class, I wish there was ""practice it"" with the algorithms to more familiarize yourself.",4
machine-learning,Excellent choice for beginners in Machine Learning or Data Analysis,5
machine-learning,Lecture videos are clear and concise with a strong focus towards applications in industry. The best practice suggestions are extremely helpful. The programming assignments are all practical and very engaging.,5
machine-learning,"Excellent the profesor make you get interest in the topic, i learn a lot.",5
machine-learning,Very interesting course! I recommend it to everyone interested in machine learning. Even though no math knowledge is needed it is getting refreshed with the course.The only problem I see is that there is no real step to work on. I do not know where to go next.,5
machine-learning,Exceptional... Was every much impressed with the way mentor explains and giving example.Thanks for providing such a exceptional Videos,5
machine-learning,"Very good introduction to machine learning. The content is fairly basic, it's up to you is you want to go deeper into the subject.Only one downside, the quality of videos is low.",4
machine-learning,This is the best to way to learn Machine Learning!,5
machine-learning,"Actually, I am impressed by Professor Andrew Ng's lecture. He made the definition and the intuition of machine learning easily understood for undergraduate like me. I learnt a lot from his lecture.",5
machine-learning,really helpful,5
machine-learning,"This course is excellently organised. You will learn very interesting things about Machine Learning, but you will also work your programming skills (MATLAB/Octave). You don't need to know a lot of algebra or programming, although every knowledge is useful. Professor Andrew Ng is excellent and all the exercises are very well explained. Forums are VERY useful too, you will get help and feedback from teachers and other students very quickly. I completely recommend it to anyone in the engineering, computer science or even other scientific disciplines.",5
machine-learning,"If you're new to ML, please, do yourself a favor and start here. You'll save yourself a LOT of time. A gem of a course. Thank you very much for taking the time to put together this course.",5
machine-learning,"Everything is perfect, except that we need to use Octave ;)",4
machine-learning,The assignment is in the right level!,5
machine-learning,A great experience with a very nice initial approach to Machine Learning :),5
machine-learning,"It is really hard topic, but thanks to the Professor everythis is really clear. Thank you!",5
machine-learning,"This is an 11-week course. Around Week 3, it became the most informative course I have ever taken, and I have three degrees. It is no exaggeration to say that the amount of information presented in this course eclipses the sum total of what is offered in many degree programs... Yes, friends: it's that good! Don't hesitate; just enroll.",5
machine-learning,All time best,5
machine-learning,I feel this course is at the appropriate level to understand how machine learning works and how it can be applied. It is not too high level where it is just concepts and derivations but not so low level that you can lose sight of the motivation of certain concepts and techniques.I recommend this course for anybody comfortable with simple linear algebra and simple programming!,5
machine-learning,One of the best courses out there; covers the material extremely thoroughly.,5

machine-learning,Awesome class! With Professor Ng as a gifted lecturer and detailed reading materials.,5
machine-learning,Very good for machine learning,5
machine-learning,Worth to invest your time.,5
machine-learning,"Professor Ng is a great teacher, his course is both challenging and satisfying. The exercises require you to take one step beyond the lecture -- not just parrot back the transcript -- you have to think about the implications of what you've just studied. Yet Ng's presentations are lucid and informative and that next step is obvious, once you think about it.My greatest challenge is that, although I have been programming for decades, I've only dabbled in a functional language like Octave and my last math class dates back to the 70s. However, the math requirements are not onerous and I'm struggling through the Octave assignments with some success.Although the course is 11 weeks there are more than 16 lectures as some weeks have two complete sets of lectures PLUS there are assignments every week that take a few hours to complete. So while there is a little more work in this course than in other Coursera offerings there is great value for the money and time spent.If you're interested in Machine Learning this course is a great place to start.",5

machine-learning,"This course is very good, easy to understand.",5
machine-learning,"A great introductory ML course. It does skips all the mathematical proofs (LA stuffs), so you don't really know what's going on behind the scenes, but it concentrates more on application (works for me!). After taking this course, I do recommend taking a more applied ML course (computer vision, NLP, etc.).",5
machine-learning,"An in-depth survey of perhaps most of the current techniques in machine learning. Very well presented, in a well-paced and understandable fashion. The mentors were very receptive and helpful with my questions. I think I spent about 20 hours per week to try to absorb the material. Highly recommended.",5

Would like to request a little more information on applying and interpreting PCA.Thank you for a very nice time and would wholeheartedly recommend this course to others who want to know more about machine learning.,4
machine-learning,great course!This course help me a lot as practical approach to the pursuit of data science career.,5
machine-learning,"Wonderful introduction to machine learning. Instructor emphasizes conceptual understanding of many topics and presents the concepts in a coherent and instructive manner. My only objection is that the course sometimes lacks enough mathematical justification behind some formulas used, but I understand that this is only an introduction so I won't complain too much about that.",5
machine-learning,An overview on the fundamental topic in machine learning. A must.,5
machine-learning,"Great material, great instructor. The use of Octave was unfortunate, though; I regularly had problems with it crashing.",4
machine-learning,"I liked how Dr. Ng introduced new topics using simple examples. Concretely, when he introduced neural networks he showed how an exclusive or could be designed using a number of logistic regression classifiers wired together.See what I did there?",5
machine-learning,Love this course for having a go at Machine Learning !! Awesome Andrew....,5
machine-learning,Best introductory to intermediate level ML course!,5
machine-learning,Fantastic course. Professor Ng is spot on with his lectures and keeps them to the point. It does help to have a background grounded in mathematics though as it allows you to focus more on the machine learning portion and not get too caught up in the other details when programming.,5
machine-learning,"Excellent work from mister Ng, everything flows. Maybe just a note on the exams where the difficulty sometimes spike a bit from the content of the courses. But you'll always get pass it if you try hard enough.",5

machine-learning,"This course was a very good start to Machine learning for me. I have learned a lot, yet i think the programming assignments were too easy to do and most of the time the answer was almost given directly. I think more challenging assignments would be better",4
machine-learning,Great course with great quality assignments from a credible and reputed expert in the field.,5
machine-learning,"Want to learn what Machine Learning is all about? Want to get the skills to start developing machine learning applications, but not to be ""tied up"" to a single tool or methodology? This is the course for you!",5
machine-learning,"The course is very good,throgh taking this course,I have a general picture about machine learning .But ,there still exsists several problems,for example,the quality of the videos are low,and I am really looking forward to new version of the course.",4
machine-learning,Absolutely great course!,5

machine-learning,Best course for machine learning.. Complex problems are taught in the easiest way possible,5
machine-learning,"Excellent! I got a degree in Machine Learning at UCL, and both during and after my studies I found clear explanations from Professor Andrew Ng when I most needed them. The course is designed this way: each thing taught by Andrew is tested, evaluated, so one can monitor his/her advance all the time. I myself am a teacher in my country, and think that this is the way a teacher should design his courses, creating resources to monitor the learning of the students on the go, all the time, with plenty of simple exercises together with few difficult projects and tests.",5
machine-learning,"Very well made, well paced. Better than majority of college courses. Some errors do pop up midway through the course that should be addressed. It can be frustrating to push through these issues sometimes but they are the only thing keeping from 5 stars.",4
machine-learning,"Great course. Challenged a lot, learned a lot. Thanks to Prof Ng and the Coursera Team!",5

machine-learning,It's a great Course overall. Its Content is great and the method of teaching is amazing.,5
machine-learning,"I started this course thinking that it's more of an introduction on machine learning, but it lays down a solid foundation for us to be able to understand complex ML applications that are in use today. It drills down to the basics and pushes you to your limits. Many a time, you're like 'Oh , this seems easy', but it's only when you get yourself to think and code that you realize that there's a lot more to the problem!It's been a wonderful experience. Thanks Andrew Ng, Thanks Coursera",5
machine-learning,"There are ton of resources for me to learn Machine Learning. But if I have to choose one, I will choose this course. Machine Learning becomes very clear and beautiful after watching lectures. I always have excitement every time I open the course. Thanks Andrew and Coursera.",5

machine-learning,This is very my first course on Coursera. It broaden my knowledge in computer science.,5
machine-learning,"Excellent course! In the first weeks, when the course started out with linear regression, I was very skeptical whether I would learn anything non-trivial here. But then I was very impressed how professor Ng managed to introduce Neural Networks until week 5 in a very clear manner. A great teacher gives you the feeling that what you are learning is easy although it is not. Great job! The only point of criticism I have is that the programming assignements are not quite hard enough to solve, but it is still a 5-star course for sure!",5
machine-learning,"Professor Ng has layed out this course very well, I'm impressed at what I was able to learn in a few weeks! The subject matter was engaging, and even the math was easy to follow with the professor's explanations. I'm very happy I took this course as this is a subject in which I've always been interested, and I'm confident I can use what I've learned in real world applications.",5

machine-learning,"This is an excellent course. The instructor provides extremely clear explanations, both from the theoretical viewpoint as well as regarding the intuition of the ideas underlying the algorithms. The course provides a complete overview of the field in a concise manner. The exercises help absorb and understand the material. Strongly recommended to anyone wishing to learn (and work hard).",5
machine-learning,The course is really clear and I absolutely recommend it if you are interested in machine learning.,5
machine-learning,A good course for introduction of machine learning.,5
machine-learning,"Loved this course! It was nice to get a real world comparison of the runtime of perfect mathematical solutions to problems like optimization vs. algorithmic solutions. In my experience, math classes tend to favor solving for variables algebraically, when the calculation of such a solution in many cases apparently takes much longer than the very accurate approximation obtained by gradient descent, for example! Also, I must admit I got a rush from implementing my first neural network, even though it was a lot simpler than I assumed it would be. I thought it was so cool to have built an autonomous program that can read numbers from a pixel array! Finally, I've always found the topic of data compression to be fascinating, so having algorithms and analysis tools for compression is pretty helpful. Thanks, Dr. Ng! :D",5

machine-learning,Overall it's a pretty great course. I just didn't find the homework that enlightening though - but I suppose that may just be a consequence of the issues involved in formatting a MOOC.,4
machine-learning,"Great introductory course to machine learning. There were some quirks to workout in the assignments and the course could use a refresh to make it more current (content is from 2011, I think). However, many of the learnings will build a strong foundation upon which any learner can continue into the interesting discipline of machine and deep learning.",4

machine-learning,"Although this course was recorded in 2011, I have found it incredibly valuable. Professor Andrew Ng presents exceptionally well providing a strong logic and clear thought allowing you to follow along and understand. Additionally, due to the fact that this was recorded in 2011, I think allows people like myself who don't have much experience with the ML topic to learn the basics as it was taught then. Many times, topics get very confusing as they grow and evolve. The level of information and concepts presented are fantastic and I've gotten so much out of my time and efforts. Thanks to Professor Ng and all of the moderators and mentors that are still active answering questions.",5

machine-learning,"Курс просто потрясающий. Я не успевала заниматься из-за ребенка и мне предложили присоединиться к новой сессии, и теперь я иду в ногу с другими учениками))",5
machine-learning,"Great hands on exercises and very clearly explained material. Was a bit slow for me I had to watch it at 2x: perhaps the simplest maths should be factored out into a separate mini course and assume a certain background for this one. The course is rather broad, though I was surprised not to hear once about Bayes or Markov (n-grams, HMM etc.). It might be a good idea to create a specialisation consisting of a separate basic maths part, all the methods presented here, methods applicable to bioinformatics and NLP too. And to top it all of Computer Vision. I assume the by-pixel techniques used in this course were just illustrating the points, as I would expect Gabor wavelets or something to reduce dimensionality and save ourselves from sliding windows (and rotations as a bonus). I am not sure if in this specialisation I would have liked to have all ""science"" points (how to run an experiment analyse results) separate from ""how to implement an algorithm"" and ""why the algorithm works"" or mixed in as this course does. I think either works. Some navigational infrastructure on coursera would be awesome (wiki style opportunities to jump around between ""aspects"" etc.). Finally, some summary notes would be very useful. When I do decide to implement any of this I will have to look through the exercise pdfs which are a bit long and at my code - perhaps, at the end, when you know someone has completed the exercises. Otherwise, the exercises are awesome.",5
machine-learning,"Very easy to understand, with little math needed. I enjoy the fact that he allows access to all quizzes and assignments without having to pay.",5
machine-learning,This is a very well designed course. I learnt a lot from it and appreciate Dr. Ng's efforts and de,5

machine-learning,This course makes it very easy to understand and learn the algorithms used in machine learning. Andrew sir explains everything with really good examples. A must take course for the people who love data science!,5
machine-learning,The course is exceptional. However there are many errata that could be corrected but Coursera refuses to do so.,4
machine-learning,"Great course, Andrew Ng does a good job at easing you into this complex subject, particularly for somebody like myself without much maths background. Looking at other video courses on the subject, I think more interactive visualisations could've been a great help, for example to gain some intuition about polynomials with different input parameters. Drawing lines on screen works, but I've had many revelations when working with the interactive tools linked from the wiki content. In some course exercises, the tutor and lecturer disagreed on the approach (e.g. vectorised vs. iterative), so the videos/PDFs were inconsistent with discussions/tutorials - a bit confusing.",4
machine-learning,Really awesome course for the beginners in ML,5
machine-learning,"has clear description for concept, and the practices can also help to realize the knowledge and know which part you are not pretty learning well.I think this is a very valuable course.",5
machine-learning,This is a great introduction course to machine learning. Coming to the class I wasn't sure if the math involved would be too complex to follow. But Professor Ng's clear explanation of the concept and intuition behind complex algorithms made them much easier to understand or dare I say enjoyable. The programming exercises are not too difficult either once you get over the first hump of familiarizing yourself with Octave or Matlab (I used Octave for the first time for this course).,5
machine-learning,The course is very good.,5

machine-learning,.It is really a good course to learn machine learning. I thank coursera,5
machine-learning,"If you are on the fence as to whether or not to take the class... take it!This class was magnificent. I had very little background (college calculus years ago and minimal computer science experience) and was able to follow the lessons, learn the concepts and apply them. I took the course to get a sense of data science and algorithmic analysis, and I came away more excited about the field and prospects than before! You get to learn at a high level how life-changing technology we interact with every day works--how autonomous cars learn to drive, how Netflix picks what movies you might like, and how text recognition algorithms can learn new text. How cool is that!?In part because of this class, I am now confident in my ability to study data science as a possible career.",5

machine-learning,good course for a new beginners but its also very old compared to modern developments.,4
machine-learning,cool course.,5
machine-learning,"This course offers an insight to most of the machine learning techniques currently deployed. However, it does not go in depth for any of it. Amazing programming exercises, very well structured, very helpful and easily understandable. They make sure that you only implement what is relevant to the course and all else clutter (reading, typechecking, etc) is already in place for you. The instructor is easily understandable and the presentations are very well structured. Coming from an engineering/computing background, would hope for more math and insights, but this is a course that can be taken by economics or other majors. Really enjoyed it and has prepared me to delve deeper into machine learning and craft ML systems as part of my school or in my free time.",5
machine-learning,A good course! The assignments really add to the program and gives you alghorithms to really work with in your own projects.,5
machine-learning,"Except the first two weeks of hard time on finding my way around the course management and its huge resources, the team of lecturers and mentors have done a great job on the preparation of this course.Thank you for sharing your knowledge and skill online.

The best course for a complete beginner on machine learning.",5
machine-learning,Great course and easy to follow!,5
machine-learning,"Great course for beginners in Machine Learning. I thoroughly enjoyed this course. However, one should not stop with this, one should try to build applications, only then would this course be completely fruitful.",5
machine-learning,"Very nice course, covering almost everything and starting form basic to advance level.Andrew is very good in explaining new things",5
machine-learning,"The best course I've taken on Coursera so far. This was the first ever course offered on Coursera, by the founder himself, Andrew Ng. He's a great instructor, covering topics right from the ground to the sky. I'd say the implementation is in OCTAVE instead of popular languages like R/Python, which could have improved upon a lot for learners. But since Andrew has focussed this course upon beginners, I think OCTAVE is apt.The assignments were relatively easy as most of the implementation (ground work) was done, only the main functions were to be implemented. But yes I learnt a lot from the way the assignments are designed. You create a digit recogniser just by being through this course.I would recommend it to all learners who are beginning with Machine Learning or Data Sciences to take up this course.",5

machine-learning,"This course was a great introduction to machine learning (ML). Besides the ML concepts and methods, the course explained the necessary mathematical and statistical concepts in a clear and simple manner. I believe people who have not done much maths or stats should be able to follow the materials. ML concepts were explained in a clear fashion with relevant examples and a good level of depth.The weekly programming exercises require the student put aside at least 2 hours but they are interesting and not impossibly challenging.",5
machine-learning,"This course is really useful and the assignment system is very helpful. The core code need to be written by you. If you want to learn ML as a starter, it is the best choice.",5
machine-learning,"Very easy-to-understand but in-depth course contents, tough some assignments contained certain bugs. Highly recommended.",5
machine-learning,"best course and very challenging. If you are a beginner in coding and programming, you need to spend more time (double than normal)in this course",5
machine-learning,"Highly recommend this course to anyone interested in machine learning. Dr. Andrew Ng does an excellent job covering the fundamentals of various supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms as well as their practical applications. He also covers error analysis and provides programming assignments.Why should you choose this course over the other machine learning courses? Dr. Andrew Ng helped lead Google's AI efforts and now doing the same for Baidu.

I enjoy the mathematical explanations of the algorithms.",5
machine-learning,Very useful and excellent machine learning class for new students in this field.,5
machine-learning,"This course introduces some basic concepts of machine learning. Particularly, neural networks and regularized regression are given a decent coverage. Some popular techniques such as decision trees and ensemble learning are not touched at all.It's a very well thought out course. The only reason I didn't give it 5 because it's in archival mode, i.e. Professor Ng doesn't support it anymore, doesn't participate in discussions, for instance. It was disappointing. Also, the assignments were too easy, in my opinion. I'd like them to be more challenging.",4
machine-learning,A very nice introduction to machine learning. Well structured and with a lot of good practical assignments! I would definitely recommend it!,5
machine-learning,Brilliant Course . Works Perfectly for me .,5
machine-learning,It was very information and had good hands-on training.,5

The pacing of the course is good, and somewhat faster than e.g. WU's machine learning specialization (where linear regression and classification take up an entire module, instead of one lecture). In that sense, this course may be a particularly good fit for people that already have some working knowledge of statistics and (statistical) programming. Also, Andrew Ng is a very good and inspiring professor.In the programming exercises, there is a lot of emphasis on vectorization, which is very useful. However, once you've wrapped your head around that concept, many of them sometimes seem a little too straightforward to implement. Nonetheless, the applications are very cool, including e.g. computer vision and anomaly detection. The (free) software (Octave) is very intuitive and easy to use.All in all, an excellent course. If only there was an ""intermediate ML"" follow up by professor Ng.",4

machine-learning,"Good overview of machine learning. In general focuses more on how to do, but due to course length skipped on some of the how or why in certain topics. Good mentor responses. Lecture video pause points are bugged. Lecture and assignments are quite detailed to walk you through it. Course content not designed to be difficult. Weeks are not very balanced. Some weeks take longer than other weeks, and you don't really know until the week starts. One thing I really dislike is you can't take notes online while watching the video. You'll have to do it elsewhere (on paper, on notepad). There isn't a quick summary of topics covered in the video you can go to. This would help if you wanted to rewatch a certain part but couldn't recall which video it was in.",3

machine-learning,Currently I am taking this course. So far it has been very good. All the Assignments I try to do it on my own with out referring to much of the hints. It gives 100% clarity on various algorithms once completing the assignments. Over all very very good course for beginners. For who look for mathematical rigour this is not the course as it is more of implementing the end expressions using Octaves. More useful for IT engineers who work in companies than Researchers.,5
machine-learning,very interesting course :),5
machine-learning,great course!I had a lot of fun learning and using those algorithms.,5
machine-learning,"It's an awesome course, focusing on purely application aspects of machine learning.",5
machine-learning,Very intuitive. It is important to have a grasp on the intuition of the concept before jumping into more detailed machine learning studies that requires more rigorous and sophisticated math. I would recommend this even for students who already familiar with some machine learning techniques. Well done for Prof. Andrew Ng and the team!,5
machine-learning,Excellent course - wonderful instructor,5
machine-learning,"This course in Machine Learing was challenging, but do-able... and very rewarding. This is the first on-line course I've taken. It has been many years since my last formal college course, so I was a little rusty at the math (I'm 55 yrs old, ancient compared to my peers in this class. My last math class was over 3 decades ago, probably before most of my classmates were born. Damn, I'm old). Even so, with Mr. Ng's teaching style, I was able to finish the course with both a good grade and - better still - a good grasp on the subject material. I will certainly continue to pursue additional learning in this area.Machine Learning is a fascinating field. I was interested in this area way back in the late 80's when I first heard the term ""Neural Network"", but there were no on-line courses in that pre-internet era, so the availability of information about the subject was very limited. It was mainly in breathless magazine articles about the coming ""AI"" revolution. It took a few decades for that promising spark to mature into a practical reality. Now, with the appearance of Coursera and other on-line education portals, much of this information is readily available to all with the curiosity and perseverance to learn about it.I am grateful for this opportunity to learn about Machine Learning!",5
machine-learning,"This was an interesting and well planned overview of a wide range of topics in machine learning. For a beginner, this course gave me a great look at the bredth of the topic. both on elements I had some experience with (SVM, Unsupervised clustering) and stuff I hadn't ever looked into before (PCA, NN). I thought the video lectures were well made and the progamming assignments were really well targeted (even if they were a little hand hold-y). Thanks to Dr. Ng and his team!",5
machine-learning,课程内容简单易学，涵盖知识较多，的确是非常不错的入门级课程，编程作业稍有难度，整体难度适宜。在此过程中学到了不少知识，为自己后续的学习奠定了基础，值得推荐！,5

machine-learning,"Exceptional course. My thanks and congratulations to Andrew Ng and Coursera for this offering. I especially appreciated Professor Ng's combination of academic (Stanford) and real world (Baidu, Google) experience, and his efforts to help students gain an intuitive understanding of the content. I think anyone who wants an overview of Machine Learning will find this very helpful.",5
machine-learning,"Taking this class was quite a challenge as I took many different classes on different platforms in preparation for my going to grad school.Professor Ng's class is, pedagogically, a very masterfully planned class. His simple but meaningful way of teaching made digestion of new information easy. He also used media to aid in teaching in an expert way, like using different colors to help keep track of variables, and using clear and meaningful diagrams.And also, in behalf of the TAs and mentors, I'd like Professor Ng to know that they are a great asset. Without their help, most notably in the form of programming assignment tutorials and test cases, this class would have been much harder. Their step by step guidance to those of us unfamiliar with R or computer programming was essential, all while upholding the code of conduct. The TAs and professor Ng make a formidable team.",5

machine-learning,"This course had fantastic content, and very clear lecturing style, and minimal errors.At times I felt the lectures were a bit too long and repetitive, and found myself jumping through them quickly. I found that Andrew took minutes to say something that should only take 10 seconds; but I am aware that most students would appreciate this.The assignments were great, only with a few bits of information lacking and one assignment requiring me to dig around in the Discussion Boards for a solution (an error in the supplied code was causing me to fail the assignment).If I could give 4.5 stars I would, but I can't give the course 5 stars given the points above.Overall: Very enjoyable and insightful!",4

machine-learning,very clear and easy to understand. Thanks a lot Andrew!,5
machine-learning,"As a software engineer focused on mobile development, I learned a lot from this course. Now I understand what ranking team is doing.",5
machine-learning,Loved it. I was able to take this course while taking a graduate school course and working a full time job. Most of the work fit into a few nights or on the weekend. The assignments were challenging but I learned a lot and it's coming in handy in my graduate school research as well. I'll be back for more courses.,5
machine-learning,"This course was a great introduction into the field of Machine Learning, covering multiple approaches and possible applications, all spread between a series of simple projects and easy-to-follow lecture videos.Many of the terms used were highly technical, and it could be difficult to keep them separate at times, but the way they were presented offered a chance for association with mathematics rather than just a word.Rated 4/5 for ability to break down complex topics and subject material. as well as the depth of the explanations, but with insufficient emphasis on application to reasonably transfer these concepts from academia to the real world.",4
machine-learning,Great course and an amazing professor - a very good applied overview of machine learning techniques.,5
machine-learning,A very good Course .,5
machine-learning,Gooood!!매우 좋습니다.강추,5

machine-learning,"A great, succinct course is for begin learner.",4
machine-learning,i recommend this is a good course for machine learning .......... :D,5
machine-learning,"Very good course, with very detailed explanations on all the algorithms and their strenghts and weaknesses. I only felt missing some words about deep learning as it is something that is directly in the field of Machine Learning and is something people talk about a lot on the media.",5
machine-learning,"Great Course, great techniques used to teach machine learning, makes sense!",5
machine-learning,"Let me say that this is a great course and that I enjoyed it very much!My only problem is with the assignment that are, in my opinion, a bit limited and most of the time they focus on liner algebra implementations rather than give a better understanding of the algorithm.Most of the time the assignments focus on implementing a formula where the algorithm itself is already written for us.That is good as a first step but in the long run it doesn't give you some practical skills when you want to apply the algorithm to an external dataset.I would suggest to add some challenges (maybe ungraded) keggle style, like provided this dataset try to get a score better than a value. This will spark some discussion and it would help to apply the concepts and the practical tricks to a real (chewed) problem.",4
machine-learning,"The course is very interesting and motivating! The lecturer is great. He describes algorithms in a very simple way, with a lot of visualization an provide good formed tasks, so that you can try algorithms in practice. I would like to thank Andrew Ng and Coursera for making this course!",5

machine-learning,"Incredibly well taught, in this first week I've already learning a _ton_ of information, as well as a deeper understanding of the machine learning algorithims.Andrew Ng releases an 'Intuition' lesson along with each week course, which helps you understand exactly what the algorithim is doing and why . These lessons are the best!",5
machine-learning,"Very well explained and extremely helpful from a practical standpoint. If learned throughly, this course gives you the tools to understand the fundamentals of data science / machine learning pipelines that are necessary for real world applications.I wish there was an advanced version of this course!",5
machine-learning,Wonderful！I enjoy the very much!,5
machine-learning,Good to start ML with this course,5
machine-learning,Just awesome!,5
machine-learning,Great introduction to machine learning,5
machine-learning,"The course is most useful for students not in the maths/engineering field. As a medical student with only high school maths and computing, I am happy to learn just enough to explore real problems in my field. It does not assume previous knowledge in advanced linear algebra, multivariable calculus and Matlab programming. I'm able to go through the whole course and finish the assignments in just 2 weeks. In contrast, I am unlikely to be able to go through the other online ML courses by famous universities or even the youtube version of Prof. Andrew Ng.",5
machine-learning,great course lots of examples,5
machine-learning,Really good intro course to machine learning,5
machine-learning,"Great course, explained very well!",5

machine-learning,The content of the course is really great. Could we have some more like this?:),5
machine-learning,"This course is carefully designed. Prof. Ng must spend much time on it. He focuses on concepts and practical applications of machine learning, and purposely left the math behind. This course is an excellent introduction to machine learning. Thanks prof. Ng.",5
machine-learning,The course really makes you understand how Machine Learning algorithms work. You have to solve challenging programming exercises to complete it. Fortunately the support given by the community is always one click away.Professor Andrew Ng is really an engaging person who transmit his deep love for the matter.I would save the fifth star for when typos will be solved and audio quality will be improved.,4
machine-learning,Very useful course! This is a basic ML course and I think everyone could learn a lot without any pressure!,5

machine-learning,great Lectures,4
machine-learning,Superb course! Great for starting with machine learning!,5
machine-learning,Loved it! A great introduction courser to start with the machine learning world. Will recommend too all of my CS friends.,5
machine-learning,"The true value of this course lies in the excellent programming assignments. From identifying hand-written digits in postal codes to providing plausible movie recommendations for users of a streaming service, you can be sure that the problems are non-trivial, applicable, and elucidating.As other users have pointed out, it is true that this is not a very mathematical introduction to the subject. Ng's concern is clearly with pedagogy and implementation over theorem-proof. However, given the abundance of rigorous (freely available) material on the subject online, this can hardly be classified as a serious shortcoming. Rather, each video lecture can be viewed as an appetiser which teaches you ""just enough"" to start coding, while opening the door for further independent study.",5
machine-learning,"This is a very good introductory course to Machine Learning that covers many different algorithms for a variety of applications. Not only does it approach the subject in a simple and intuitive way, it also provides very good advice for implementing and running these algorithms. The programming assignments are well done and, through the use of provided code, allow you to glimpse at interesting applications of machine learning without having to spend too much time on boilerplate/preprocessing code.",5
machine-learning,非常棒的课程！,5

machine-learning,"Great course. I feel like this is oriented towards high-school students, a little rudimentary at times, but nevertheless covers a great breadth of subject. The course would be way to dense if he tried to go for depth as well, and would be appropriate for a much smaller audience, so I respect his decision.",5
machine-learning,One the first courses on coursera. Very detailed and approachable. Definite recommendation if you want to learn about machine learning.,5
machine-learning,"A good balance of theory and practical tips. MATLAB assignments take time but most of the work is done for you, so you only need to apply the concepts you've just learned. (Optional) deadlines help a lot too!",5
machine-learning,Less intellectually stimulating than I would have liked it to be but fairly comprehensive,4
machine-learning,"I truely enjoyed to listen to the lectures and to do the assigments.I have learned a lot and I wanted to thank you for this great opportunity- to learn from AndrewSo again, thank you",5
machine-learning,"Great course -- very challenging, well taught and a very efficient way to acquire fundamental skills and understanding in this exciting field of machine learning, AI, data science, etc. Andrew's teaching style is very thoughtful, engaging, and you know he's really passionate about the material. I highly recommend this course!",5
machine-learning,"Excelente, te enseña conceptos básicos y fundamentales así como algoritmos de alta complejidad. Estoy muy agradecido a Andrew Ng, sobretodo por su dedicación y visión de la educación.",5
machine-learning,"Great professor, good material. If anything the class was too easy.",4
machine-learning,This Course was a great starting point for me to get into AI.,5
machine-learning,excellent machine learning class,5
machine-learning,"Awesome, one of the best things I ever learnt",5
machine-learning,Very nice.!!!,5
machine-learning,This course is simply great. Prof Andrew manages to make complicated math topics seem almost intuitive. This is definitely a must-watch for those interested on ML.,5
machine-learning,"It's one of the best courses I've ever taken. Prof. Andrew Ng is fantastic teacher, I'd be happy to have more courses under his guidence...",5
machine-learning,Excellent course material for folks curious about machine learning. Right balance of lectures and lab exercises.i would sincerely recommend this course to all curious minds. Prof. Andrew Ng is a great teacher,5
machine-learning,"This was a fantastic course. I worried that it would be over my head, particularly since I have not taken a math class since I was in college nearly 40 years ago. The class provided an overview of the math I needed and then consistently presented algorithms and challenging concepts in an accessible fashion. I highly recommend this class to anyone who wants to get started doing something practical with machine learning and artificial intelligence.",5
machine-learning,Very interesting course!,5
machine-learning,Excellently put together.Little trouble with the Matlab licensing duration though.,4
machine-learning,+,5
machine-learning,A great collection of well designed lectures and practice assignments that helps you get familiar with the science of Machine Learning.,5
machine-learning,"Professor Andrew is great, and about discussions Tom es another great guy, he was a big help for us, was an amazing course.Quizzes sometimes are a little bit tricky and if you understand very well the classes you can do easily the matlab challenges.",5
machine-learning,"One of the best online courses I've ever taken. The videos are clear and concise, and most people with an interest should be able to follow along, while the assignments are still challenging enough to keep it interesting and increase learning.",5
machine-learning,Un cours excellent qui traite les principaux aspects du Machine Learning avec une ligne directrice sur la gestion de l'erreur et les différentes techniques qui visent à réduire cette erreur. NG présente les problèmes de réduction de cette erreur avec la gestion du Gradient et les différentes options pour éviter les minima locaux. Ensuite on comprend mieux l'impact des paramètres de régularisation pour la régression logistique ainsi que les spécificités des architectures neuronales. Le cours nécessite un investissement certain en temps pour comprendre le contenu et préparer les exercices sous Matlab mais on apprend beaucoup dans ce cours même sur des sujets plus complexes comme les SVM et les Kernels. Ensuite pour ceux qui veulent mieux comprendre les traitements de l'image quelques exemples (ce n'est pas mon domaine). A la fin NB aborde le Big Data avec Hadoop et la parallélisation des traitements (initiation). Il ne manque que les approches autour des techniques d'Arbres (absence totale) et les réseaux bayésiens ou algorithmes génétiques. Mais c'est un très bon cours,5
machine-learning,Extremely well designed course to introduce many practical aspects of machine learning.,4
machine-learning,"This is a fantastic course for ML beginners, and it's also worth to ML expert for reviewing.Thank you all very much for your work.",5
machine-learning,Great teaching from Andrew Ng. Never thought I could learn so much online :),5

machine-learning,Excellent course very well organized.,5
machine-learning,Exceptional content and absolutely amazing tutor.,4
machine-learning,"This was an eye-opening course for me. It provided me with a whole new way of thinking about programming and solving problems. Now, for example, when visiting web sites I view recommender systems with a much better understanding of what they are doing behind the scenes.",5
machine-learning,"I really enjoyed taking this! It was taught in an understandable way, and even with little MATLAB knowledge the assignments were very doable. I learned a lot and feel I'll be able to apply these skills to tasks in the future.",5
machine-learning,Very well done!,5
machine-learning,"This course gives a very thorough introduction to Machine Learning, Octave and concepts behind ML. Hands on assignments are very good at introducing students to a variety of problems and builds a very good foundation.",5
machine-learning,A must course for the Beginners in Data Science World.,5
machine-learning,"Was a little too basic. Would have preferred more flesh (both implementational and mathematical) on the bones. I also found it absurd that each time the professor introduced a very basic linear algebra concept he kept saying somewhat patronizingly ""this is for the experts in linear algebra"". Come on! If one is taking a machine learning course, one can expect more from the students. Otherwise the course ends up being a flaky tap-dance on the surface of the material.",2
machine-learning,Good!!,5
machine-learning,Very solid course with a wonderful professor!,5
machine-learning,"Great course for those interested in having a deep understanding of how the machine learning concepts and algorithms work. The instructor is very knowledgeable and is an excellent teacher of the complexities. Students should have a background in statistics and/or higher math (e.g. calculus, trigonometry, etc).",5
machine-learning,虽然课时不多，但是涵盖了大部分机器学习知识，非常实用。,5
machine-learning,Well prepared and well delivered. You need some serious understanding of stats and algebra but if you are ready to make the effort it worth every minutes of your time,5
machine-learning,具有系统性，理论结合实际，利于学习和吸收,5
machine-learning,This is a friendly course. It gives us a fundamental understanding of ML,5
machine-learning,"Strengths:1. Programming exercises are really valuable, they solve real problems, and they are not too hard and not too easy, just fine!2. Teaches you the way of developing a machine learning system and evaluating them3. Does not need so much previous knowledge of math(it is also a weakness)4. Gives intuitions about the models and algorithms while not using too much theoretical stuffWeaknesses:1. weakness, this course will not teach you the mathematical/statistical models in detail, for some persons(like me) it is importantAnyway, this course was awesome ^_^",5
machine-learning,深入浅出，非常适合初学者,5
machine-learning,Great lesson,5
machine-learning,Best course content!,5
machine-learning,A very good introduction. Leaves one equipped enough to know the relevant areas to advance into ML,4
machine-learning,A very good summary that will help you to navigate in the future ML techniques.,5
machine-learning,Its a good beginner class. I found that the assignments were simplified to make it easier for folks not experienced in programming.,5
machine-learning,"Loved the course, basic explained very well, assigments could be more challenging and built in python/R.",4
machine-learning,Very Impressive course. Very Nice Teacher. I learned many from this course and hope that Dr. Andrew Ng can create more deeper and interesting course about this field.,5
machine-learning,I especially love the professor's enthusiasm and passion for helping everyone learn cutting-edge machine learning knowledge. I would say it would be me to blame if I failed to learn machine learning. Dr. Ng has done his best. The rest is really up to me now.,5
machine-learning,Excellent! Lectures are easy to follow and very interesting and assigments are very challenging. Had an excellent experience with this course and strongly recomended.,5
machine-learning,"Excellent course for all those who would like to get started on Machine Learning. Prof.Andrew Ng has delivered this course in great style, that even the most complex aspects are made to look very simple. Course assignments are well designed to test the real learning of the student. I thoroughly enjoyed solving those real problems. I'm confident to claim, that I'm a Machine Learning product designer now. Its a huge leap for me, personally.Thankyou Prof.Andrew Ng and Coursera Team.",5
machine-learning,"Great teacher, great guidelineBest ML MOOC ever !!",5
machine-learning,Really GREAT!!,5
machine-learning,"I truly enjoy the course with all lectures, assignments and discussions. Thank you Andrew for making such a great course!",5
machine-learning,"Wonder Prof. and coherent informative material, the only minor issue is the bad sound quality, other than that it is excellent and recommended for everyone passionate about the field of Machine Learning.",5
machine-learning,"This class can be an introduction to people who are beginners of this field. To me, it gives me some basic concepts of machine learning, and a better understanding of how it works. Andrew is an attractive person who can encourage you to be fond of this course. For the public with different background , the mathematics of this course has to be easy, but the actual situation is that you should be good at calculus，statistics，linear algebra，convex optimization and so on, although most of them I have touched when I was a freshman. if you want to go deeper into it. There is still a long way to go!! In summary, I love Andrew, I love this course, and I love ML",5
machine-learning,This lesson give a brief introduction of how to analysing the real problem by machine learning. All you need to do is to prepare the data,5
machine-learning,"Very good, this was my first course in Coursera, very interesting topics about learning algorithms.",5
machine-learning,"The lectures were good to excellent. The homework assignments were decent but felt a little ""dumbed down"". If it had been based on Python or R instead of MATLAB/Octave it would have been better though.There were lots of problems with submission using Octave. I almost quit because I just couldn't get it to work correctly, at least on a Mac. Switching to MATLAB made it easier. But MATLAB isn't something I'm going to be able to freely use after the course.Overall I found it to be a nice basic introduction to Machine Learning. It seems to have really just scratched the surface in terms of depth, but the breadth was good. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an introduction or first course in machine learning.",4
machine-learning,"very useful and helpful, thanks",5
machine-learning,Great course! I learned a lot.,5
machine-learning,This course is simply amazing! This course is great for someone who wants to get started with machine learning and go to intermediate depth. Andrew Ng does a splendid job explaining the core concepts of machine learning. I would highly recommend this program for someone who wishes to learn about machine learning.The only con is perhaps that the algorithms are implemented through MATLAB/Octave. But this will perhaps not be a problem for someone who already knows R/Python/C/Java.,5
machine-learning,Excellent course for any beginner in machine learning.,5
machine-learning,很不错，很实用，不过还是有不足的地方。比如，没有给出额外的资料。因为Prof . Andrew Ng似乎在课堂video中多次提及很多内容超出了这门课的范围所以没有给出详细的证明和答案。当然，其中一部分可以很方便地在google中搜索得到，而另外一部分则没有这么容易。为什么需要额外的资料呢？因为我觉得这门课应该只能算是Introduction to Machine Learning如果想要继续提高，那自然希望可以有额外的资料。,4
machine-learning,Excellent pacing and balance of programming and theory work. Have come away with a much better overview of the field in general as well as more detailed experience with a number of academic programming examples.,5
machine-learning,It's worthy purchasing!,5
machine-learning,Amazing! Great explanations of basic machine learning concepts.,5
machine-learning,Great introductory course !,5
machine-learning,"Awesome course, Andrew NG is just perfect. I hope there will be more to come ! Keep doing the good job guys !",5

machine-learning,the best machine learning course,5
machine-learning,"Andrew is one of the best teachers I've ever had. Externally smart and articulated, but also super thoughtful and humble to explain the easiest things assuming we might not know. Assignments were challenging, but forums and mentors were totally worth it. This was a very hard class for me (non technical background), but the best online class that made me engaged all the way to the end.",5
machine-learning,I thought the course was a great overview of machine learning. The information was presented in a very application oriented and practical way. Very understandable. Would like pointers to further reading or maybe a virtual reading rack.,5
machine-learning,"Very interesting and comprehensive. It has the level of complexity that I need: enough to go into details, but not too much so that it can be done in parallel with a regular job and doesn't require too many hours.One topic that's missing and that could be addressed in future revisions: reinforced learning.",5
machine-learning,"Extremely practical course for begineers. I earlier worked half way through ""Learning from data by Caltech"" which was much more theoretical for my taste. I highly recommend this one for begineers. And do complete the assignments!",5

machine-learning,深入浅出，通俗易懂,5
machine-learning,"Andrew explains things in a very clear way. Some of the quizes seems redundant, ie., ask very basic questions which can be answered with common sense w/o knowing the content, but all in all give good intro.I gained enough knowledge to challenge PhDs specializing in ML when we brainstorm stuff.",5
machine-learning,Delivering the awesome course with best mentor.,5
machine-learning,Love this course! Definitely need decent maths and some coding experience. You can get frustrated doing assignment without good linear algebra and some debugging experience. But it will be very rewarding experience once you go through it.,5

machine-learning,"Andrew Ng dives right into the subject matter of this course yet provides real world samples of the applications of machine learning. The exercises provide significant challenge if you're rusty on calculus and completely new to this topic, so I would recommend joining a study group or creating one yourself. I would take this course again to refresh the concepts of machine learning, especially if it is revised to stay up to date in the future.",5
machine-learning,这门课非常好，老师讲的非常清楚，内容也由易到难，每个知识点做在笔记本上，做习题做代码作业的时候拿出来看看，一切都清楚明了。而且，恰巧把里面的代码运用到毕业设计中，哈哈哈，在应用中也可以学到许许多多的知识！！！强烈推荐这门课！！！,5

machine-learning,"Could not take when I was studying at Stanford because of required and important core courses. Taking it now, and it is worth it.",5
machine-learning,"This is a great intro to machine learning, but it needs to be polished and updated. There's too much discrepancy over the assignment descriptions and the tutorial discussions. Tom Mosher is fantastic in the tutorial forums - would have spent many hours wandering aimlessly if it wasn't for his guidance. However, he does point out many holes in the course as it currently is, and I'd have to agree with him. Linear algebra review should absolutely be a requirement prior to the beginning of this course.",3

machine-learning,The course is amazing. Its too bad that I am not able to complete it.,5
machine-learning,"Hi. This is a great course which would be made even better with the small change I describe below. I was referred here by Nicole who was handling this as Support Case #1188060. I understand the mentors have been seeking this improvement for some time. Please let me know if I can clarify or assist in any way. Thanks in advance.---- Support Case #1188060 ----Hi. I'm writing regarding the Machine Learning course taught by Andrew Ng of Stanford. I have learned there is a compilation of ""errata,"" known errors in the videos and course materials for each week, which has been made available in per-week links like the following:https://share.coursera.org/wiki/index.php/ML:Errata:_Week_7I found these links only after digging through discussions. In my own discussions afterwards, I learned that I wasn't the only one having trouble finding the errata. Apparently it's a long-standing problem which creates extra work for mentors as well as slowing down students. Would it be possible to provide the errata links, or a link to the Machine Learning Course wiki, in a dedicated section of the Course Content? This would help a lot of people. Please see the discussion below for more perspective.https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/discussions/RQNTlee5EeWTdBIkpCpI1QThanks for your consideration.Tom :-)",5
machine-learning,深入浅出，就是这么概括,5
machine-learning,very good deep learning of ML,5
machine-learning,"Awesome course, thank you Andrew Ng!",5
machine-learning,This is a pretty good course for machine learning area,5
machine-learning,Now I understand the hype around this course.,5
machine-learning,THX~,5
machine-learning,Prof Andrew displays tremendous teaching skill. He is able to get down to the level of novices and explain things with visualization without getting too mathematical. At the same time introduces complexity in a phased manner. Awesome course. Thanks Prof and thanks Coursera.,5
machine-learning,非常深入浅出，是机器学习入门的好课程！,5
machine-learning,The course is easy for starters to get the hang of what actual machine learning and artificial intelligence is. It's really a good course.,5
machine-learning,Really clear way of teaching Machine Learning!,5
machine-learning,"The professor is the best one, explian everything in details making easy to undestand the concepts.",5
machine-learning,对于初学者多少略有英文障碍。。。感觉效率太低决定再提高一下英语再以更高的效率学习,5
machine-learning,感谢吴老师带入门，尤其是时间分配、确定问题、调优方面的经验分享。,5
machine-learning,"Awesome. This course spoils you, since no other courses come close to this standard (at least the ones i have taken). But if it was not on demand, i think it will be very very tough, so great to make it on demand.",5
machine-learning,"Since this is my very first online course, I don't have too much to compare it to, but I thought the lectures and the quizzes / programming problems were very focused. Especially the coding where a lot of the ""grunt work"" was done for you, allowing you to focus on the actual machine learning algorithm which was helpful in grasping the application of these complicated concepts. I especially liked the later part of the course where emphasis was made on understanding how to make educated decisions about where to spend time enhancing the performance of the ML code & training set. This will save the potential ML student hours and hours of work. Thanks to the professor, producer, and moderator(s).",5
machine-learning,A fantastic introduction to the field.,5
machine-learning,Very cool stuff. Instructor explains in a very understandable way. I do recommend you have some basic background in programming or matrix algebra to keep up with the pace of the course.,5
machine-learning,Very rich. I am very grateful to Mr. Ng for teaching such a great tough course in a methodical way.,5
machine-learning,"This is a wonderfully taught course. The lectures are clear, well-organized, and engaging, taking full advantage of the online format. The homework assignments take care of a lot of the legwork of machine learning for you (particularly data loading/cleaning) and let you focus on implementing the core algorithms. It's a powerful feeling to implement the heart of a neural network from scratch.I feel like I came out of the course with a solid understanding of many core concepts in machine learning.",5
machine-learning,"excellent course, it would be better if you also read the Machine Learning book.",5
machine-learning,Very informative.,4
machine-learning,One of the best course to learn machine learning. Assignments are just awesome.,5

machine-learning,Great course on introduction of machine learning.,5
machine-learning,"Andrew不愧是大牛,讲的非常棒",5
machine-learning,"There are a number of issues with this course, and more generally Coursera. While the course does cover the material, it uses non-standard mathematical notation. This can be very confusing and seems as if it is purposefully so. There are several mathematical abstractions used that perhaps have a purpose in later machine learning applications but seem unnecessary here.Another issue is that the course assumes the use of Octave which is not available for Windows users apparently. It also allows the use of MatLab but the quiz questions are in Octave which means the quiz is not necessarily testing understanding of the course material as it is Octave.Generally, the opportunities for feedback to Coursera are highly limited. A colleague once took a course online (through another platform). Some of the course material was objectively wrong. However, there was no ability to submit feedback. I have the sense that this could easily happen with the Coursera material. It totally undercuts the apparent validity of the platform.",3
machine-learning,"Amazing insights, challenges, and rewards fort those with dedication to and interest in the topic.",5
machine-learning,"This course is just awesome. Prof Andrew explains everything in a simple manner. I tried following machine learning on other platforms, but i find this one on Coursera the best!! Thank you Professor and Coursera.",5

machine-learning,"I am studying this course, all the points are being made crystal-clear as is expected from such a great prof li",5
machine-learning,"I have seen other machine learning courses but it cannot get any simpler than this. Most of the other courses will directly dive you into complex formulas and theorems. But Mr. Andrew Ng made it so easy for me to understand the basic concepts with his real world examples that now I can apply them in my own projects with ease. The evaluation system is also pretty good with hands on assignments. The quizzes were a little bit tough at times, but they forced me to go back to the corresponding topic and review it so that my concepts become clear. The assignments were also realistic and at times challenging for people using Matlab or Octave for first time. Thank you very much for this course. I hope this will help a lot in my career as a researcher.",5
machine-learning,I very appreciate for this class.I learned a lot. Thank you!,5
machine-learning,"This course teaches the fundamentals of various machine learning algorithms.

I will remain grateful to the people like Andrew Ng for sharing knowledge so beautifully.I personally was attracted to the idea of discussing machine learning applications via the programming assignment, they kept me motivated in difficult times. I look forward to doing other interesting courses in the data science track.Thank You!!",5
machine-learning,"Can't say I got a full understanding of what ML is all about, but at least I know what to search for should I need to use it now.The assignments seemed to be very hard in the beginning, but as soon as I got used to them they appeared to be too simple. All I had to do was to find correct order of matrices multiplication. I would like to be more involved in solving them.Nevertheless the course is quite interesting and, I hope, quite helpful.",4
machine-learning,A,5
machine-learning,"Very good and thorough course. Everything is explained to the root, so for all the things you learn you learn why you are learning this, how it is used, and in which situation you would us it. I did have some previous experience from taking a computing science master, but I thought the difficulty level was perfect. You have to think about it, but there is enough explanation to make everything clear.I enjoyed it.",5

machine-learning,"Fantastic course. I wish the assignments were python instead of octave, but a great course nevertheless.",5
machine-learning,Very clear instruction,5
machine-learning,"Fantastic. Andrew Ng is a naturally charismatic teacher with a knack for anticipating issues which his students may encounter and assuaging them before they become sticking points for later understanding. By their nature, online courses cannot benefit from students asking questions of their instructors so it is doubly important that instructors be aware of areas which may confuse students and take anticipatory action to avoid this- this is only one of Ng's strengths. Beyond this, Ng is simply an enthusiastic instructor whose passion for his subject is contagious. He also conveys a genuine sense of understanding the student's process of coming to grips with more difficult portions, often explaining what has confused him before (though, given his expertise, one may wonder just how much these areas actually give him difficulty). All things considered, the biggest disappointment is that there are not more courses available with Ng as the instructor.",5
machine-learning,Excellent course and deep understanding of how ML works using different algorithms and analysis,5
machine-learning,很不错，机器学习中很多基础概念和基本运用方法都有很棒的讲解。,5
machine-learning,"This course is well structured, starting from the more basic concepts and building on those as it goes. The practical advice is also a breath of fresh air compared to most other courses which just give you theory and leave you hung out to dry when it comes to application of what you have learned, and how to figure out where you might have gone wrong. Andrew Ng is great at explaining things, and doesn't make you fuss around with things you don't really need to know to be a useful machine learning practitioner.",5

He's more than a brilliant researcher: he does a terrific job of presenting complex machine learning concepts in simple terms that a very easy for anyone to understand as well. I would add that the programming assignments are also very useful because they focus on core concepts and really help to reinforce the lectures. All around this is easily one of the best and most valuable courses I have ever taken, and I would be very quickly to recommend this course to any friend without reservation. Whether you're actively working with machine learning systems as I am or hoping to get into the field or merely curious, Andrew Ng's machine learning class is a very valuable class that covers the essentials and covers them very thoroughly.",5

People with good mathematical background and MATLAB experience will find completing this course a breeze.",5
machine-learning,"Easy to understand explanation. Good lab exercises that focuses only on the algorithms itself, while additional code is added to show you what you implemented.",5
machine-learning,"All the topics are explained in a clear way, possible applications are always underlined, many examples are given through the course.",5
machine-learning,"Professor Andrew Ng has presented the content in a really learner friendly way. The student absorbs the knowledge without even noticing. 10 weeks later, you wake up - and just know it all. Great job Mr Professor.",5
machine-learning,I wish the materials went faster but if this speed is necessary for something my opinion now doesn't matter. Used really cool method of explaining.,5
machine-learning,Excellent!!! Andrew Ng is not only a great researcher but a great teacher. He explains in a very clear way complex concepts and keeps you interested all the time. Great course to start in ML,5

It's amazing to look back in all the subjects studied and how each one is built on top of each other. It is also good how there is always a programming exercise that really makes you think about the content studied on that lesson.I think the videos really need some post production. Some videos could be shortened since there is repeated material: Andrew decides to restart the explanation, because he messed up or something, but the part the he messed up is still in the video.It would be good if the Wiki that is present in Week 1 could also be present in all other Weeks, so we as students could feel encouraged to write the Wiki of each Week.",4
machine-learning,"Great course. Makes it easy to understand basic concepts and algorithms of most popular ML methods through program assignments. Methods like logistic regression, SVM and Neural Networks become easy to comprehend and are not a ""black box"" anymore.",5
machine-learning,Great Course and Great Teacher!.Most of the topics covered are described in clear and practical way and the programming exercides help to get a better understanding.Perfecto to have an initial but solid backgroung abour Machine Learning.,4
machine-learning,"Professor Ng enhances this course with many practical, real-world examples that we can all relate to. He also focuses on ""how to intuit"" things before diving into the details. The Matlab/Octave labs were useful and it was fun to see my ""handwritten digit classifier"" process images and correctly identify the digits.",5

machine-learning,Great Lessons!!! Easy to understand all the difficult and challenging algorithms with vivid examples and graphs.,5
machine-learning,absolutely great. Dr. Andrew Ng is one of the most best professors. He makes the material so simple to understand,5
machine-learning,"My CS friend recommended me to take this course to learn more about how to use data in business, after he heard that I wanted to program an app for food. he warned me about the great deal of math involved (mainly linear algebra). me being a physics/engineering major I naturally got even more excited (it turned out that he was right, and it would also be a huge plus to know multivariate calculus, and I can see myself struggle with the concepts had I not studied both these topics to bits in school). incidentally, this was my first online coursera experience. I can tell you it will be life changing experience. No longer do I have to physically travel somewhere to listen to lectures or hand in assignments, nor download lecture notes off of the school server. This is a 24/7 always on always available service, with the best TA's to answer your questions if you get stuck on homework assignments and quizzes. Everything in the coding assignments tests your knowledge of the course lectures and is designed such that you can complete it in the shortest possible amount of time while reaping the maximum amount of benefit. It is ""easy"" sense does not require you to grind through mundane things like looking for your own training set data or writing code to plot and visualise the data, but it is ""hard"" in the sense that very often it takes an hour (or more) of studying the lectures and thinking to figure out how to solve the problem in the most efficient way as possible which often involves writing a single line of vectored matlab/octave code. It is more of an overview of the most important topics in machine learning, but will be a great springboard to go in depth into each aspect of it. Lastly, Andrew often offers wonderful insights into the day to day of machine learning professionals in his lecture videos, so I would advise watching every single minute of them to get the most out of the course instead of aiming to race over the finish line (which can be tempting at times when the deadline approaches)",5
machine-learning,The assignments are really aimed toward learning the course. It would be more exciting if optional assignments were more complicated.,5
machine-learning,Excellent! The one every Coursera-er should take!,5
machine-learning,Much more interactive than I expected. Pace is a bit fast especially if you are doing this with a day job but still great to follow and learn.,5

It has become very easy for me to interpret any Machine Learning problem and attempt to solve them.Please convey my deep sense of gratitude to Andrew Ng. Without him the coursera and the accessibility of courses like this would have become impossible for people like me who are from developing country.I have few suggestions regarding Machine Learning Course :1. If possible can we have a Machine Learning Part 2 course which is more advanced w.r.t content (math oriented), data munging, some more algos and with more focus on industry applications.I have few suggestions in general :1. Few relevant courses are shown as archived (Eg. Neural Networks) for past few years. Can you unlock them and make them a recurring course like 'Machine Learning'.Thanks,Arun",5

Being proficient with Linear Algebra is a big plus, in particular with matrix operations. If you are not, not a bid deal, but I recommend spending a good amount of time on the review lessons. Trust me.The choice of Octave/Matlab as a programming language makes perfect sense. Not everyone is seasoned programmer. I found it is fairly easy to pick up Octave syntax and become quite proficient in a few days. The course has also a few Mentors active in the Discussion Forum that make your life a lot easier.",5

machine-learning,Outstanding course.My only feedback is you force the students to use Octave/MATLAB. I used Python do all the assignments but I didn't bother submitting my answers to get credit for the course because I would have had to reimplement it again in Octave.Maybe give some more in-depth optional assignments? I would have liked to have actually implemented a SVM rather than use a lib (at-least one time).,5
machine-learning,fun to follow with insightful easy to understand examples,5

machine-learning,Absolutely incredible stuff! I enjoyed this course a little bit more than my university course as I could pace and time this course. About to finish and get a course certification. I recommend this to everyone! Andrew NG is an incredible lecturer who has not helped me learn Machine Learning but also helped cement a life long passion for Machine Learning.,5
machine-learning,很好的课程，深入浅出,5
machine-learning,"Very good introduction and advanced insight in the field at the same time. A performance to get to the essential without getting entangled with the maths, while you will need at least a little understanding of algebra.",5
machine-learning,Big fan of Prof.Andrew,5
machine-learning,Good course for learn Deep Learning.,5
machine-learning,"This was my first on line course and the experience has been amazing. The lectures by Prof Andrew Ng were clear and the follow up programming exercises helped reinforce and enhance the concepts covered in the lectures.The entire course was very well organized - videos, notes, discussion groups, suggestions and tips by the mentors was very easy to follow.The focus of this course is on the practical application of machine learning techniques (supervised learning mostly but also some non supervised learning). Prof Andrew tries not to get into the advanced mathematical concepts but instead provides good intuition and then shows one how to apply the different ideas underpinning machine learning with some practical examples. In my view, this is an excellent way to quickly become familiar the concepts and to see machine learning in action. A student of the course will gain very good insights and can then follow up with the underlying math as needed.The final two lectures on how to scale machine learning to large systems and a suggested systematic framework for figuring out which aspects of the design to focus on were very instructive.In summary, i would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in the area of machine learning. Be prepared to work through some challenging (but very worthwhile) programming exercises to get the most out of the course.",5
machine-learning,Very useful and complete course.,5
machine-learning,Very well put together.,5
machine-learning,Worth it!!,5
machine-learning,"Excellent course. However, it is more practice oriented, so I wouldn't recommend it if you are interested in gaining a deep understanding of the mathematics behind the ML algorithms.That being said I highly recommend it.",5
machine-learning,"Excellent introduction for the basic understanding of the Machine Learning. Very good, structured, easy to follow and understand course for anyone whose has previous exposure to linear algebra using MATLAB and Octave.The mentors appear to be very active and hence should not be trouble for anyone without very strong background ( read prerequisite like Linear Algebra especially for the assignments). The Assignments are self explanatory enough that I did all of them in just 2-3 weeks, thanks to my 2-3 years of coding in MATLAB and linear algebra.Thanks very much Prof. Ng and the team!",5
machine-learning,"Great Course, Simplified way of understanding the topic, although i was expecting machine learning to be much harder than that,, the teacher could convince me that it's not that hard and that i really do it and pass,, it was fun taking this course, i was really enjoying it, thanks to the great motivator Professor Andrew, thank you very much for your efforts. i know now i'm ready to work on much harder machine learning application and much more sophisticated ones, 100% satisfied :))Thank you VERY muchHeba Alawneh",5
machine-learning,"Very good course, but too focused on quantitatively analysis, maybe the practical applications will come in subsequent weeks.",4
machine-learning,真的非常棒的课！,5
machine-learning,"This class was a great introduction to machine learning ideas and implementation. Prof. Ng does a really good job of not only showing you how to code up machine learning examples in MATLAB/Octave, but explaining the rationale behind them. If machine learning is as much an art as a science, then this is the ""artistic"" part, which is hard to find in a textbook.However, I do kind of wish we had covered fewer topics, but in more detail. Mind you, I'm biased because I was a math major and want to see proofs for everything, but I would have really liked to see more of the details behind support vector machines and neural networks. If you're looking for that kind of thing, then it's probably best to do additional reading on your own.Anyway, I still gave this class five stars because I have been searching for an introduction to machine learning that could give me a broad perspective (and share some wisdom of expertise) for a while now. I found it in Andrew Ng's machine learning class on Coursera.",5

Although the principle of Neural Network is a little ambiguous introduced in class, it is still the best choice for novice like me.",5
machine-learning,Good overview of ML. Does not require a deep mathematical background and therefore lectures are not as rigorous as Alex Ihler's lectures (youtube) which take similar or less duration.,5
machine-learning,I have learned a lot. The things are easy to understand but useful.,5
machine-learning,"This course's video lectures are carefully created. They present exactly the information you need to know in such manner, that people with different backgrounds and mathematical and MATLAB/Octave will understand. The course community is always there to help. I've learned a lot already and I'm only halfway through the course.",5
machine-learning,fantastic learning experience so far.,5
machine-learning,"This class is awesome! Although, I wish he would do a redo of it with Python.",5

machine-learning,质量非常高的一门课程，是我机器学习的启蒙课程。Professor Ng讲课很清楚，课程结构设置的非常合理。非常感谢Coursera提供这样优质的课程,5
machine-learning,Fue un curso excelente curso. Las explicaciones son suficientemente claras.,5
machine-learning,"This is the best Machine Learning class I ever took, after taking several ML classes in real life and online. Unlike most other ML courses focusing on math, this class specifically emphasizes on how to analyze/debug a system. The programming exercises are extremely well-organized and helpful in implementing the algorithms and debug the performance problems. The instructor is doing a fantastic job in making things clear to people from all background.The videos may seem long and the programming exercises take a long time to complete. But the effort is so worth it.",5
machine-learning,Amazing! Taught me the basics so I can move on to anywhere I please when it comes to Artificial Intelligence.,5
machine-learning,Great starting point to learn Machine Learning. Difficult concepts were explained clearly.,5

machine-learning,really impressive and useful!,5
machine-learning,Useful and very friendly to learn !,5
machine-learning,Very Good~,5
machine-learning,"Thanks you, Andrew Ng",5
machine-learning,"A great great machine learning introductory course with a lot ground covered -- but the best part is most of these methods are nicely packed into one convex optimization algorithm gradient descent. There are a lot of ""tricks"" that will be very helpful in real world projects.",5
machine-learning,Brilliant,5
machine-learning,课程内容生动易懂，习题中给出的提示很有帮助。,5
machine-learning,Excellent Course. I learnt a lot. It has a lot of fun & exciting real-life practical examples.,5
machine-learning,Excellent course. The videos provide a lot of intuitions and are technically sound. The weekly assignment are very helpful to better understand these new aspects.My only concern is that I wish Andrew Ng could teach other classes than Machine Learning :-),5
machine-learning,Absolutely the most useful course for anyone who is interested in machine learning. The course explains almost common models in a way that even non-statistical background learners can understand with ease.,5
machine-learning,"Fantastic introduction to Machine Learning. I come from Physics, and so my prorgaming knowledge comes mainly from the numerical side of computing, and I found this course was excellent at providing a bigger insight in how numerical algorithms can be applied to real world problems, as opposed to only being able to solve analytical ones. Thank you very much for this course.",5
machine-learning,"It is pretty fast paced as well in depth course on Machine Learning. First five weeks are hard and mainly focused on building foundation while rest of the weeks teaches very useful technique to broaden the knowledge. Professor Ng has done awesome job as well as all the mentors. There is so much information on the group discussion, I hardly had to post anything as most of the answers to my questions are already there. wiki page is great and I did read it before taking any quiz. Some quizzes are super hard and I had to attempt few times to pass those.",5
machine-learning,"This is an excellent introduction to ML. Coming from a mathematical background, I felt that at times the course was a bit slow (e.g. Professor Ng would spend time performing steps on every element of a matrix, when a couple of examples would have sufficed), but jumping ahead in the video solved this problem easily. I was a bit more frustrated, however, with the few instances of, ""here's the formula, you don't need to know the derivation."" I guess those who want to understand the math behind the techniques can always look elsewhere, but Professor Ng obviously knows a great deal and is able to clearly and concisely explain difficult subjects, and so I was a bit disappointed to not be getting his instruction in the more difficult aspects.But, overall this course is great. In particular, I found the programming assignments to be excellent. They are a good level of difficulty, and manage to be quite interesting, as well. I will definitely hold onto the code I wrote for this course for reference as I move forward.Professor Ng, please create a more advanced course next!",4
machine-learning,Good introduction course to machine learning.There is no capstone project which is a disappointment,4
machine-learning,very well framed course.,5
machine-learning,Entrance level course. Much easier than CS229 provided by Stanford University. You don't need to prove the maths formular. All that you should do is to understand how to use.,5
machine-learning,exhaustive explanation with proper detailing of the concept.,4
machine-learning,A great course and the best part is that it is self paced and the concepts are taught from bottom up in a very simple manner and lets even a layman understand the core concepts while always pointing to more advanced resources and techniques. Perfect Introduction to a vast field.,5
machine-learning,The historic course in Coursera but still relevant until today!,5
machine-learning,Learn a lot about ML from this course. Very helpful for a beginner in the ML community,5
machine-learning,"Great course content. Andrew Ng is a great teacher, and the course structure worked really well for me.",5
machine-learning,"Perfect for machine learning beginners. I really enjoyed this course.Here are what I enjoyed most:The instructor provides intuition about how the techniques work, gives you just enough amount of details, looks at the applications, etc. Well done.",5
machine-learning,"I miss some practical examples and applications. It is great, but too much theory.",4
machine-learning,easily can understand,5
machine-learning,"This is the best introductory course I took about ML. Real problems with real data and all done in Jupiter. Each week has a theory section with a test at the end and then a practical part where to apply all the knowledge learnt.Thanks to all the team, specially to Carlos Guestrin and Emily Fox for your enthusiastic way of teaching (you did a great job).",5
machine-learning,Brilliant Course. It is more like Fundamentals of Machine Learning,5
machine-learning,"The course is technical enough, complete and well thaught. In few weeks it will literally enable you to many opportunities in the ML field.",5
machine-learning,Excellent. Well balanced theory and,5
machine-learning,really great classes!!! hoping more,5
machine-learning,Best Course for Machine Learning,5
machine-learning,"An excellent overview of a hot and powerful field. Interesting and relevant examples. Some typos remain, but most are minor and easily discovered.",4
machine-learning,"Sometimes the course may feel too basic, but it makes everything very clear. Closed lots of gaps in my knowledge about machine learning. The only regret I feel that the course does not cover decision trees and bayesian networks.",4
machine-learning,Sir Andrew NG has helped me a lot to learn about Machine learning which would prove me to be build a great platform in learning and experiencing the practical applications in the field I have chosen.I sincerely thank Sir for giving me this opportunity of grasping and implementing the same(Machine Learning Algorithms). Also it would help enhance business problems and apply my knowledge further.Thanking You !,5
machine-learning,High Level Course! The topics are explained with great competence and exercises in Matlab are really useful.,5

machine-learning,Awesome material at awesome pace. Building solid platform for advanced learning.,5
machine-learning,"Dr. Ng does a great job transfering his knowledge and experience on the subject to the on-line students, describing in detail every equation and every subscript.Since I am new to Machine Learning, I will keep my notes from the Course as a reference.The only minus is that I had to pause many times the videos in order to write my notes. Maybe, it would be better if the slides were offered as downloads...Thanks a lot Coursera!Filoktimon Repoulias",5
machine-learning,a great course!,5
machine-learning,This was an extremely well put together course. The lectures content and format were amazing and made complex topics very approachable. I am very happy I took the course.,5
machine-learning,"This course manages to be approachable while still covering a large variety of subjects. By the end of the class you won't be a master of any particular machine learning algorithm, but you will have a good idea of what you need to study further. Probably one of my favorite classes ever (and not just at Coursera).",5
machine-learning,Best intro into machine learning.,5
machine-learning,"This was my best 11 weeks ever. I got really a lot here from Andrew. I was glad to have this opportunity of learning advanced technology and completing some examples for application. Thanks a lot! And thank you, Andrew, for Machine Learning Course and this website Coursera! It is literally an incredibly amazing place for studying.",5
machine-learning,"Thank you, Dr. Ng and Stanford for this excellent course. Although I do not become an expert in machine learning, I learned a lot to apply to my projects. I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn the advanced artificial intelligence.",5
machine-learning,"Excellent course. Difficult at the start, especially if you have not looked at math symbols and statistics formulae in a while, but worth pushing through. I tend not to move on until I completely understand something but with this course it was best for me to accept some of the formulae as truth and move on. Eventually I started seeing the light, and towards the end of the course I got what was going on in the earlier lectures.",5
machine-learning,"This course is magnificent! It was a great pleasure to make programming assignments and watch lectures.Practically, it was so good, that I'm thinking of making some career choices soon.Thank you!",5
machine-learning,Brillant,5
machine-learning,"Excellent Course and Well detailed lectures. For a beginner in Machine learning, i am able to understand the concepts clearly. Quiz and Assignments are really good and interesting. I am hoping to complete this certification by new year",5

machine-learning,Paradigmatic video lecture by an amazing Andrew Ng.,5
machine-learning,Good balance between theory and hands on exercises. Very enjoyable.,5
machine-learning,Andrew is a great professor. Explained the topics clearly.,5
machine-learning,The best online course i've ever attended. The explainations are crystal clear even for non-methematicians and the topic is widely covered ( No deep learning nor bayesian methods though). If only my former college teachers would've been half that good..,4
machine-learning,Concepts are very clearly explained. Programming exercises are really helpful. If only a more technical counterpart of this course is available.,5
machine-learning,An excellent course for beginning! Technical organization is very well. It would be great to have a continuation,5
machine-learning,"very good, but i think more suggested materials are needed.",4
machine-learning,非常棒的课程，通俗易懂,5
machine-learning,Thank you for conducting this valuable course.,5
machine-learning,Fantastic course. Andrew Ng is a great professor who has the ability to make a complicated subject very simple,5
machine-learning,"The exercises lead you to the edge of a cliff, then push you off. No guidance. Good luck if you don't already know linear algebra, matrix math, and matlab. I'll be looking elsewhere to learn about Machine Learning. Glad I didn't pay for this course!",1
machine-learning,Andrew Ng and his team prepared well structured course full of fantastic study materials.,5
machine-learning,Great course! Absolutely recommendable!,5
machine-learning,"This was my first coursera class, and I came out feeling confident in my use of the methods that Prof. Ng taught. The programming exercises do a very good job of guiding students through the implementational details of each learning method and usually provide examples to illustrate the strengths, weaknesses, and options within each. I'm a graduate student in a protein structure/rational drug design lab, and the topics from this class have already weaved their way into my projects. These methods are applicable to almost any quantitative form of data - I strongly recommend this course for other young researchers, either to prepare to implement the methods themselves, or to just start thinking about how to format the conventions of their sceintific domain in a machine-learnable way!",5
machine-learning,"Andrew is excellent at explaining things. Unfortunately the course doesn't go through some of the derivations because it is introductory, but he still offers a reasonable explanation / intuition for most of the content. This is the de-facto standard ML class for beginners and a good intro to coursera and online courses in general. Take this course!",5
machine-learning,"Excellent course, great speaker !",5
machine-learning,Great intro to applied machine learning,5
machine-learning,Excellent course. The material is presented clearly. The assignments give a great practical overview of Machine Learning.,5
machine-learning,Really nice course to start with machine learning.,5
machine-learning,"This is a very good introduction to machine learning. It seem liked the right combination of breadth and depth for me. Each concept was coupled with a real life example, which was great. This course has motivated me to explore the field further and I would recommend it to others as well.",5
machine-learning,Awesome instructor and great course overall! Materials are well-presented and the programming assignments helped me reinforce the contents from lecture videos! I definitely recommend anyone with even slight curiosity about what machine learning is about take this course from professor Andrew Ng!,5
machine-learning,This course is awesome. It is a great start for people who want to do machine learning,5
machine-learning,Excellent Course,5
machine-learning,Kudos to the creators of this course!,5
machine-learning,"excellent course, Thank you Prof Andrew Ng",5
machine-learning,Perfect! Got a lot after learning.,5
machine-learning,Bit too fast.,4
machine-learning,"However good the material and lectures may be, the use of an outdated version of Octave (which is not Mac-friendly and exceedingly brittle, to the extent where the supplied code requires manual patching in Windows and Linux) is a complete turn-off and makes it nearly impossible to complete the assignments on time unless you're prepared to spend at least twice as much time debugging your setup as doing the actual assignments.I'll come back when this is done with R or Python.",1
machine-learning,"A truly fantastic course. Extremely useful, practical, relevant content and examples, plus such a great teacher as well as very helpful course staff and other students. Thanks Andrew, team and the rest of the students.For anyone considering doing the course, note that the time requirements can be a lot - the lectures are fine but two or three of the assignments took far more than 3 hours (if you plan on actually battling through the coding this is relevant. I'd highly recommend that anyone considering doing the course does the assignments since this is where the real magic happens - Andrew quite deviously leaves a bit of the theory to be fully worked out by yourself in the assignments).",5
machine-learning,A large number of topics covered.A very good explanation of the material.Interesting programming assignments.,5
machine-learning,Excellent course on Machine Learning. 100% recommended,5
machine-learning,Great course with a lot of interesting material. Although it is too simple and I missed more advanced topics and mathematical details.,5
machine-learning,"A really good course. The teacher explains a lot of different topics clearly. You will learn a lot of Machine Learning. Moreover, there are practical works that help you to implement what you see during the video.",5
machine-learning,Really gain a lot from the courses!,5
machine-learning,Best course! Best instructor! Instructor has complete grasp on the subject and augments every lesson with pertinent examples to make everything lucid. Thank you Sir Andrew Ng!,5
machine-learning,Clear instruction and insightful assignments.,5
machine-learning,"Very accessible course about machine learning. I strongly recommend to anyone interested in ML! Andrew Ng's lectures are very informative and clear. As a bonus, you'll even learn to use Octave or Matlab.",5
machine-learning,Excellent and Clear. Very Simple and at the same time complex. Provides a great practical learning experience.,5
machine-learning,"My first course online but one of my best student course.Very interesting course, easy maybe too easy.",5
machine-learning,"Awesome course, really like it !",5
machine-learning,"The course was well organized and structured.It was a bit complicated to get the submission process starting, due to the patches necessary.It is a very nice course to demystify machine learning algorithms.",4
machine-learning,"My first course on Coursera and definitely worth it. The time load is 3-5 hours a week, which might be a scary number, but I'm glad I did it as I now have a nice overview of the things possible with ML.",5
machine-learning,Great introduction into Machine Learning algorithm and as well a good refresher for practioneers.,5
machine-learning,Thank you again!,5
machine-learning,"This course was great! Andrew Ng did a wonderful job of explaining the material and keeping it engaging. The questions on the quizzes were relevant and provoked thought, not just recall. The programming assignments were interesting and have you implement actual ML algorithms.If Andrew offered another class, I'd take it!",5
machine-learning,"The standard for intro to machine learning. Everyone recommends this as a first start.It could be updated for newer practices, though. No trees, no cross validation folding, etc.Rather than submitting Octave code, it would be cool if you could write the program in a language of your choice. They create a random set of data each time, and you have to produce results within a certain tolerance of that dataset.",5
machine-learning,good！！！,5
machine-learning,Great course. Hard things explained simple way. Very much recommended to everyone who want to start with ML.,5
machine-learning,"Great Course, learns a lot !!",5
machine-learning,Best course on ML there is.,5
machine-learning,"Excellent course, completely recommended. Explains very well, and the exercise really help you understand. Gives quite enough real world examples to understand the use of what you are learning.",5
machine-learning,"It's not hard to follow, and very interesting.",5
machine-learning,nice course，nice teacher.,5
machine-learning,"An excellent course! - easy to understand, programming exercises focus on the implementation of key ideas which saves lots of time in coding.",5
machine-learning,"Prof. Andrew Ng's presentation is pretty intuitive and effective. For me I've almost forgotten the Linear Algebraic after graduated for years, but it is still easy to 100% understood what he taught. The exercises are also designed very practical for us to better understand the lectures, and I think I can deploy them for my future work as well. This learning series is really helpful and seems open an window for me to understand Machine Learning, since I thought it would be very very hard to understand before attended this series. By now, I am proudly to say that I am in the room of this great discipline. I really appreciate Prof. Andrew Ng's effort as well as the support team.",5
machine-learning,Great course!! I have learnt a great deal. Can professor Ng deliver more lectures on advanced Machine Learning?,5
machine-learning,Best Course I have taken! Course is well organized and doesn't get boring. Would recommend!,5

machine-learning,Some of the lectures were noticeably not edited properly.,5
machine-learning,"Excellent course, very well explained by Andrew Ng! :) Many, many thanks to Andrew Ng and all the other that contributed to that course! :)",5
machine-learning,"Really good, you can learn important concepts, the course is plenty of exercises and practice, But even better you can have recognition for work and, like in my case, get new contracts and clients.",5
machine-learning,Perfect!!,5
machine-learning,"It should be in Python, but it's great nonetheless!",5
machine-learning,"Great content, well documented, good exercises and scripts for work submission",5
machine-learning,Great teacher! I wonder if this course could be done in python.,4
machine-learning,Best!,5
machine-learning,Excellent lectures and material. Very motivating content with the presentation of real life applications!Thanks.,5
machine-learning,Excellent hand holding into Machine Learning world. It's like a hop-in hop-out bus tour of Paris.,5
machine-learning,"This is a perfect fundamental course for machine learning. It's really recommended for people who are interested with this subject but fear for the mathematics it might involve. Professor Andrew NG made all related algorithm easy to understand and interesting. Besides, the programming exercise are very considerate, you can learn a lot from practice.",5
machine-learning,Really an awesome course! Thank you!,5
machine-learning,"At the beginning, I thought it would be hard for a starter in ML; however, during the process, I found the course setting is easy to follow, especially the quiz, which help me master the key point of each class. And the programming exercises give me the intuition in applying each individual ML skills. I think the course settings are convenient and practical. So after finishing the course, I have excuse to recommend other ML beginners to join the course, which will help to build a skeleton of the knowledge about the concept, algorithm, and skills in ML. AND thank Andrew and Coursera for giving such an practical guidance.The suggestion at last what I want to append is providing some further courses or future direction after this course. However, maybe I can get them from the course forum.",5
machine-learning,"The course is well organised, with cutting edge knowledge ready to use in our information era. And Andrew was really decent with clear illustration and explanations. I really enjoy taking this course!",5
machine-learning,An extremely great course to build strong foundations of Machine Learning concepts.,5
machine-learning,nice!,5
machine-learning,"many great real world examples, excellent labs and fantastic Professor!",5
machine-learning,"I believe this is the most enjoyable nine weeks course that I ever had. Prof. Andrew has his way explaining a complex mathematical concept in an easy and non-intimidating way. I used to be afraid & dislike when it comes to statistics, machine learning related field. After following this course, I've gained a bit more courage to learn more complex and exciting field. The Quiz and programming works are challenging but enjoyable to do. It gives me more understanding about the topic while having fun applying the concept to real problems in my field of work.The course itself is really interesting and relevant if you are in the software engineering field. There are a lot of concepts that you can apply to your work. I highly recommended to follow the course and do the assignment.",5
machine-learning,The course content was excellent. Only drawback was voice recording quality.,4
machine-learning,Andrew NG is an amazing pedagogue and his course is the reference knowledge for Machine Learning.,5
machine-learning,"Great course, great leader.",5
machine-learning,Excellent course! Mr. Ng is great lecturer with great ability to explain even the most complicated concepts. I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn about machine learning.,5
machine-learning,"Excellent course, I believe is the best course I had ever take.",5
machine-learning,Really interesting so far. Learning a lot of cool things. Might be time for some updates as some of the course material seems really old.,4
machine-learning,Great course but light on the mathematical part would love to get those insights.,4
machine-learning,"The course provides a sizeable amount of pretty cohesive material, which can still be understood by non-CS students. It's very practical and it includes a very nice mix of quiz tests and great MATLAB/Octave programming assignments. After going through the assignments I started wondering about other problems which data sets I can plug with small modifications into the completed solutions. Andrew Ng keeps a great balance between explaining important details and skipping over parts that require straying too much from the main topic of the lecture. I still don't have very deep or broad knowledge in the Machine Learning domain, but it feels like the course doesn't miss anything of the fundamentals.Overall, I'd definitely recommend the course to CS students, high-school students with interests in the computer science area and even specialists in other areas with some knowledge in linear algebra with interest in the AI and ML domains.",5
machine-learning,"Great course, focus on the practical application and giving you the tools to actually implement something and get it to work well. Couldn't recommend this highly enough.",5
machine-learning,I would totally recommend this course to someone looking to get an insight about the most popular methods of machine learning. The video lectures are well explained and the programming exercices are a really good guidance to learn by yourself to put everything in practice.,5
machine-learning,I enjoyed the course. It covered many machine learning topics and supplied good advice and simple working example. It is a great practical guide.,4
machine-learning,Very well presented. Thank you Sir!,5
machine-learning,assignment might be bit more hard and complex.,4
machine-learning,"Really helpful, explanatory and teaching class! I'm learning a lot of practical methods which can be applied on many systems. The level of classes are enough for many people from different backgrounds. Thanks to all contributors especially to Andrew Ng! :)",5
machine-learning,"This is how an online course should be! Quizzes, Programming assignments, Questions change when you retake quizzes! Would've been better if a reference textbook was suggested that one can grasp more information from. I couldn't rate the course below 5 though. Recommended!",5
machine-learning,"one of the best online course out there for any beginner to learn machine learning. Even if your background of maths is not strong, don't let that stop you from joining this course. The instructor is very good in explaining basic mathematics. In short, advance calculus is not a requirement for this course (but good to have).",4
machine-learning,nothing like anything..!,5
machine-learning,i'm very excited whole during the course.i'm recommending to join this course to all guys who is working on IT indurstory.i would like to say a lot of thank you to teacher ng!,5

machine-learning,"Andrew Ng is such a great teacher. The course content is well structured, that it makes learning very easy.",5
machine-learning,The maths got a bit complicated at times and the Octave programming work was challenging to say the least but these are positive points. Sometimes similar courses are sometimes too easy and pitched at the beginner. This is certainly an intermediate to advanced course but I'd recommend it 100% to anyone who is thinking about gaining a deeper insight to how machine learning models work.,5
machine-learning,"Clear explanation, with lots of encouragement;Excellent programming homework",5

machine-learning,Excellent course. Very well explained by Andrew Ng.,5
machine-learning,"This course presentation is simple and easy to digest with some hints about where the complexity exist. The exercises also well designed to lead student to the right direction without worrying too much about implementation detail that support the main topics. I usually focus in the wrong direction while learning something new. This trap is frustrating, but this course is really enjoyable.Thank you for making this course.",5
machine-learning,cool,5
machine-learning,One of my favourite professors and one of my favourite courses.,5
machine-learning,Explanation of each topic is so Excellent.And Teaching Methodology is like as we required.Every programmer should have the knowledge of Machine Learning,5
machine-learning,Lectures contents are clearly explained and well organized. Math is clear; equations and symbols are consistent.Programming assignments are well organized and to-the-point; everything you need to know to do the assignments was covered in lectures. Submission process is easy.,5
machine-learning,"Great course, the teacher did a very good job explaining a very difficult subject to a group of students with signifficantly different backgrounds.The quizzes were easy to solve once you took the time to see all the related videos. There was a little bit of handholding in the programming assignmentes, but that may be due to the aforementioned backgrounds the student came up with.I'm a spanish speaking mechanical engineer with just a programming hobby and I was able to finish with a 99% grade. If I could do it, anyone can",5
machine-learning,I found this course very useful and easy to understand.,5
machine-learning,Awesome work there prof Andrew Ng.,5
machine-learning,Very easy to understand.Good fundamental knowledge for people who don't have any basic on Machine Learning.,5
machine-learning,Very nice course oriented with concrete application exemple.,5
machine-learning,Very nicely explained lecture even non programming background person can also learn with ease,5
machine-learning,"This is a very good introduction to machine learning. It covers a very broad set of material, and the lectures are very clear. The quizzes and programming assignments are based directly on the course material, making it easy to complete the assignments if you understand the lecture material (in contrast with some other courses I have taken where the assignments require lots of extra material not taught in the course). It is very helpful to have some programming experience, and some knowledge of linear algebra, probability, and calculus. The course is very topical, so it does not go very deep into the material, but it does offer some practical advice for using machine learning algorithms in daily applications.",5
machine-learning,"Although the course is requiring some time to spend on to benefit from, the topics covered are very well introduced with accurate examples and explanations to understand the practical side of this topic.Also, the programming assignments where really challenging while kept in line with the material provided during the classes.I definitely suggest this course to anyone interested in covering the basic and the most advanced topics in machine learning, having said that it still remain an introductory course to ML.Thanks a lot for the fun I had and the huge amount of new things I learned.",5
machine-learning,FUCKING AWESOME!,5
machine-learning,I felt like the Octave tutorial was a little light.The concepts were explained well through the videos. Intuition was given which is always useful. I think an improvement would be more examples in the videos or as example sets for the sections to help. Jumping straight into the assignments without applying the lessons first in a mistake-allowable environment is a bit daunting and can feel overwhelming.,4
machine-learning,"Really good structured, well explained and useful materials.Thanks, professor Ng!",5
machine-learning,"My first coursera course. I've taken others since but this has been head and shoulders above them. Very interesting, very informative and at just the right level for me. Don't skip the exercises, they can be tough but I found they really cemented my learning.",5

machine-learning,Fantastic course that builds great intuition for machine learning algorithms.,5
machine-learning,Awesome course! Learned a lot and can't wait to apply it! Professor Ng is really good at teaching and the mentors and discussion board are really helpful!,5
machine-learning,This is a great course. My only concern is that it goes slow at times and it feels like topics are being discussed repeatedly. I would rather have the wiki lecture notes prominently displayed for my reference rather than having to watch very nuanced lecture videos because I sit through a lot of uneccessary video out of concern that I will miss something important.,4
machine-learning,"Professor Ng is excellent, I have really enjoyed this course.",5
machine-learning,An excellent way to start learning about AI,5
machine-learning,"Very interesting course.The course material is very good, and Andrew Ng is very clear and interesting.It's the best course I have been following through the Coursera platform.",5
machine-learning,it really helps me a,5
machine-learning,I love machine learing,5
machine-learning,This course is specially good if you have some experience on ML but without knowing the details. I recommend it!,5
machine-learning,I like the way this course is designed. The lectures are very articulate. The thing that impressed me most about the Professor is; Students who doesn't have sound calculus and vector algebra understanding also can complete this course easily. Assignments are application oriented and some are challenging too. The Questions in Quiz assignments are in such a way that they test your understanding of that particular lecture and the summary of it.,5
machine-learning,"Clear and to the point lectures, valuable assignments that contains useful code for deeper exploration and further use.",5
machine-learning,I have excellent experience in learning the basics of Machine Learning. The mentor is just awesome in explaining things.,5
machine-learning,Great course about machine learning. Thanks for NG and Stanford University.,5

machine-learning,Very clearly analyzed and very practical!,5
machine-learning,A basic and systematical,5
machine-learning,easy to understand,5
machine-learning,"I understand that many people want to quickly jumping on the topic, but there should be a minimum set of prerequisites before starting this class. This would avoid digressions such as explaining basic vector/matrix operations or unnecessary calculus reviews.",3
machine-learning,Very good course! I can only encourage anyone to take it if interested in the subject.,5
machine-learning,"The BEST lecture ever.Professor Andrew Ng magically makes everything so easy.The assignments are not that challenging but appropriate for all students who didn't even took any of computer science class..overall, again, the best !",5
machine-learning,Andrew Ng's teaching skills are exceptional.,5
machine-learning,"This is an excellent survey course in Machine Learning for anyone who isn't an expert already. It moves at just the right pace to keep you challenged without being overwhelmed. The staff are very helpful, and the professor makes sure to get his point across before moving on. In fact, if I had to offer only one criticism it's that sometimes he will repeat the same thing over (many many times), which is unnecessary and thus sometimes frustrating because we have seek bars and speed control for the lectures.It's quite remarkable how well this course communicates a high-level understanding of the concepts without bogging it down with much of the scary math that is often associated with ML. For those of us who are interested in getting into the nuts and bolts, the professor makes sure to name concepts so that they can be further researched at one's leisure. He gives you what you need to solve the problem, but doesn't do it for you.I highly recommend this course for anybody interested in learning how many of the most useful technologies of this century actually work.",5
machine-learning,perfect lesson,5
machine-learning,"Great course !Just had to re-pass all my assignments when the certificate became available, because the first time I passed them my identity was not verified.Also, it would be nice to have some kind of ""download all the course's content"" link at the end of the course, to be able to save the material for later reference.Thank you for this fantastic course !",4
machine-learning,very good~,5
machine-learning,"Really good course, very easy to understand, especially with lots of Homeworks/Labworks.",5
machine-learning,"Great course. At the beginning, the of this course, I just want to learn something about neural network, but then I was fully attracted by this course. My major is biology but Andrew successfully makes me understand every point here. It is logical and understandable. It does not mean that it is an easy course, but reflects the elaborate work and deep understanding of Andrew. Now previous hard fields like computational biology and bioinformatics became quite easy to me.I can easily find out the algorithms they apply and know their shortages. If only I can know machine learning several years ago!The course covers the underlying mathematical analysis of several famous algorithms like neural network, SVM, PCA and recommendation system. It contains clear instructions to answer 'what', 'why' and 'how' levels of them, and to their actual applications and limits including the workflow to check the quality of my product. It is magic to realize that the advanced technologies like face recognition and auto-driving are just built by such basic blocks.Learners can have a solid understanding of the different fields in machining learning, and decide whether or not to go further. I proceeded to learn probabilistic graphic model, and hopefully it might be my key figure in my research paper on interfering casual relationship and influence of protein interaction during neural stem cell differentiation",5
machine-learning,"Very well structured course. Professor is excellent. Lecture videos are easy to understand, have good examples, and are well organized. The assignments are relevant and illustrate the process of actually running machine learning.However, the scope of topics does feel a bit too ""intro/basic"" and the material and assignments feel spoonfed. It would have been great if the course went deeper into each topic and also challenged the student to do more coding independently in Octave/Matlab.",4
machine-learning,很棒的课～,5
machine-learning,super !!!,5
machine-learning,Pure computing magic!,5
machine-learning,"This was a pretty great course. With a focus on understanding and coding regression algorithms, I was engaged throughout the course. I'm a programmer with a physics B.Sc trying to make a shift away from product development and in to analytical problem solving. I found the lectures useful, the wiki useful when I didn't have time to watch the lectures, and the quizzes and assignments very practical.",5

machine-learning,It's an excellent course,5
machine-learning,The course content is just right with practical exemples and less overwhelming theory.,5
machine-learning,"This is a great intro course to ML. The content is focused on the techniques used to build basic ML algorithms rather than the tools used to conduct analysis. Andrew Ng choice to use matlab as the programming language is great, so the focus is on understanding the mechanics of ML and not on programming itself. Coming from a Engineering background, I had so much fun watching the lessons and working on the assigments.",5
machine-learning,Excellent introductory course with challenging and informative assignments. Primarily for those with previous programming experience but little exposure to machine learning.,5
machine-learning,"Extremely good course to start with machine learning. Clears basic concepts without going into too much detail which makes it ideal for students with no background in calculus. Also, the structure and content is well organized and topics are not rushed upon. You not only learn algorithms but also best practrices to follow to achieve better accuracy. The programming exercises are also really good. All of this makes coupled with the helpful Coursera community to guide you when you are stuck- up with a problem makes it an ideal course to start learning machine learning.",5

machine-learning,"Excellent course that lives up to its reputation as a great introduction to Machine Learning. You'll learn a lot of the relevant concepts via lectures and apply them through the quizzes and programming exercises. Basic programming knowledge would be helpful, but no deep statistical / computer science / linear algebra background is required to fully enjoy the course. I've taken formal Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence classes as a CS undergrad and still found this course to be very useful in both refreshing and learning concepts. Thank you Dr. Ng!",5
machine-learning,Really well structured and pedagogical course! I really enjoyed it even though I would have liked it to be a bit more technical. I think a bit too much is supplied in the programming exercises and I would have preferred more mathematical proofs and derivations in the lectures.,5
machine-learning,"I love this course. Although it contains many basic ideas and fundamental lessons, all are stated, and explained very well.

machine-learning,teacher is fanta,5
machine-learning,"An extremely useful course designed very beautifully and presented in a very lucid manner. The assignments help in bringing out the technicalities of the course very efficiently. And the quiz questions help a lot in gaining intuition.However, it MUST have a sequel.. another course that takes students deeper into Machine Learning concepts and tools of the trade.",5
machine-learning,"Excelente profesor, muy bueno el curso.",5
machine-learning,Very little prerequisites. Professor Andrew NG explains the complex algorithms very neatly and tries to provide a intuition behind each algorithm.,5
machine-learning,"Nice course, easy to follow good introduction",5
machine-learning,"great overview of the topic. professor nguyen is very engaging. the only downside is from an applied perspective in that the coding is in octave, whereas most data science i've seen done these days is in python or R",5
machine-learning,A very good introduction on machine learning. Andrew Ng is a good instructor and does a very good job of explaining the concepts.,5
machine-learning,Nice Course of Machine Learning Introduce,5

machine-learning,Really useful and fantastic course. But the tutor's words are so fast and the course's content is a little hard to understand. Maybe give us more time will be better.,4
machine-learning,亦可赛艇！,5
machine-learning,A must-take course aspiring machine learning practitioners.,5
machine-learning,"I am a physics postgraduate student and want to take a career in the field of computer science. Although I learned some related mathematica course at the undergraduate stage, this course still gives lots of intuition why the algorithm is designed in such a way, how to obtain the information from the massy data and how to improve our algorithm based on our data. Thanks very much, Andrew.",5
machine-learning,老师讲的很有趣,5
machine-learning,这课程讲得通俗易懂，难度适中，非常好,5
machine-learning,"Excellent 11 week course, highly recommended and with real world relevance.. Very knowledgeable and personable lecturer is an effective communicator. Tutors are helpful and responsive. Informative discussions forum and helpful tutorial guidance and useful test cases. Guided programming exercises with Octave/Matlab in which the authors have done most of the grunt work, leaving the student to fill in a few critical bits.The only down side was that the course changed from being uncertified to certified, about 80% of the way through. Would need to redo/resubmit virtually all assessments in order to qualify for certification, which is a fair amount of time/effort, that I'm not sure that I can spare.",5
machine-learning,Excelente curso,5
machine-learning,Best course in terms of the science of Machine Learning!,5
machine-learning,Thorough and easy to follow.,5
machine-learning,Great lectures ! Mathematical and practical aspects are both taken into account. Andrew Ng is really clear and gives good explanations.,5

machine-learning,Perfect ! Prof. NG,5
machine-learning,课程内容很不错，例子特别多，而且讲解的很彻底，编程应用更赞。但是唯一感觉不是很爽的就是似乎Andrew的语速有点偏慢，导致必须要快进才会觉得正常，而且似乎视频中有些东西重复的比较多。不过总的来说，这是我修过的最好的网上课程，到目前为止是最好的，没有之一。,5
machine-learning,"Easy to understand, fun to learn.",5
machine-learning,"Appealing, useful, and joyful",5
machine-learning,清楚明了，适合初学者,5
machine-learning,very informative.,5
machine-learning,I like this course.,5
machine-learning,This is a great course ! The pacing is just right. Andrew covers each topic in very easily digestible bits and is very careful to not overwhelm beginners. I find this technique incredibly refreshing and open and welcoming. It is all too easy for professors to act like elites in their ivory towers and make you feel foolish for not knowing enough but Andrew is the opposite of that and actively encourages you to push through difficult topics by focusing on the high level details first and leaving it up to you to research the details on your own.The programming exercises are set up so that all the distracting details are all coded already and it's up to you to fill in only the parts that are directly relevant to the topic you are learning. There's only one exercise that is slightly confusing but it's easy to get help on it in the forums if there's a helpful moderator like Tom Mosher around !Highly recommended.,5
machine-learning,This is an amazing course! Very well structured and clearly explained with a lot of concrete examples.I really enjoyed and learned a lot!,5
machine-learning,"Course is really good, it covers a lot of different topics at once on a good level, so you can continue studying by yourself. Forms good understanding of machine learning. In my opinion one of the most important things is that the lecturer tries to explain each and every topic and not just give the ability to use it, there are a lot of step-by-step examples and additional explanation videos. Programming assignments are also good, they cover a lot of material and give real examples. Definitely recommend this course. It's fun.",5
machine-learning,"The programming exercises aren't really all that challenging...just implement the formulas provided in the course or in the assignment itself, and you're mostly done.I hate the questions on the quizzes that are ""Select all the following that are true..."" The only questions I ever got wrong on quizzes were of that sort.",4
machine-learning,Quite a journey. Learned a lot.,5
machine-learning,Best,5
machine-learning,"This is a great course with great mentors and helpful resources. Would recommend for anybody who likes to learn about machine learning. It is just a starting point. Having good knowledge with Calculus, Linear Algebra and Satistics will help a great deal but are not mandatory. However this is not realy true if you really want to understand the formulas and concepts presented. (So: Would recommend if you learn some (at least basic) topics on calculus, linear algebra and statistics before)",5
machine-learning,Thank you for this awesome class!,5
machine-learning,The lectures and the assignments gives a perfect grip on concepts.,5
machine-learning,Pursuing this course is by far the best thing that I have done. Any one who wants to get into the field of Data Science or atleast understand the nuances of Artificial Intelligence you should definitely take this course.I'm a great fan of Andrew Ng Sir!,5
machine-learning,Top Course ! Very instructive !,5
machine-learning,Valuable course for career grow,5
machine-learning,"This is an amazing course, I wish I could have Andrew Ng explain everything I needed to understand.",5
machine-learning,just great !,5
machine-learning,"Machine learning is the best online module I've taken so far. Professor Ng makes those technical concepts visible us in a very understandable way, and the course assignments are at just right difficulty.I'm quite inspired by the content of machine learning and want to pursue a future career in this area. It would so great if some higher level courses come next, with focus on the application of machine learning algorithms.",5
machine-learning,"Thanks Andrew, It is a beautiful course",5
machine-learning,"A great course, and it is very interesting to think over the issue that was put forward by the professor.",5
machine-learning,Highly recommend! Simple & clear explanation but get straight to the points which we need to know.,5
machine-learning,This course is a fantastic resource which I would highly recommend for potential practitioners of machine learning. In particular the advice for debugging machine learning systems is hugely useful.,5
machine-learning,Very good with essential knowledge,5
machine-learning,The concepts are explained masterfully with a focus on understanding rather than high-level mathematics which most of these topics invariably deal with. Plus the exercises give a real feel for the practical questions that Machine Learning can solve and the method that practitioners use most often.,5
machine-learning,I love Andrew Ng's clear speeking and the ability to make complex knowledge simpler.,4
machine-learning,very good course and useful but not so difficult homework. Prof Ng is a superb professor. Everyone who is interested in ML should take this course.,5
machine-learning,The original and best machine learning course,5
machine-learning,Before i started this course i just thought i might not be able to finish it because machine learning is hard.Prof.Ng makes it so easily understandable and inspirable. And you just dont need very high level math knowledge to go through this course. It's great to learn this course. Thanks.,5
machine-learning,Thanks professor..!! Your way of teaching has really helped me to understand the subject.,5
machine-learning,"Hello, the course is great. Only one suggestion is to go a little bit deeper in subjects such as SVM optimization techniques or PCA mathematical background. At least a good set of references could be suggested for the interested s",4
machine-learning,"Solid course materials, interesting examples and cases, sometimes really difficult, learned a lot!",4
machine-learning,awesome course. Great lecture delivery by Andrew NG,5
machine-learning,Excellent presentation of the subject matter with clear illustrations.,5
machine-learning,I always go back to refer the materials here. This course bring me basic ideas about machine learning.,5
machine-learning,I really enjoyed learning the intuition behind machine learning. I also benefited from knowing whether more data would be helpful or not as well as whether it is worth my time to improve the accuracy of a certain part of my algorithm!,5
machine-learning,Absolutely top-quality. Excellent choice of content. Goes into much detail,5
machine-learning,this is a very good lesson!,5
machine-learning,It's a great course for the beginners of the machine learning!,5
machine-learning,I have done about half of week 1 before and so it was nice revising those fundamental concepts.,5
machine-learning,This Curse is very useful. Dr Andrew has explained the course in most lucid manner. Anyone with almost no background can easily comprehend and avail the benefits of machine learning.,5
machine-learning,"Learned a lot from this class. Helped my have a much better understanding of what a lot of companies are doing with machine learning technologies. Of course, there are a lot of practical know-hows that we can only gain from real world projects, and this class is well worth the time that I have put in.",5
machine-learning,"Great course, great teacher! Inspiring!",5
machine-learning,"A practical course by a capable professor. Too simple in terms of theoretical aspects, but Prof. Ng is very good at making abstract concepts and methodologies easy to follow and understand. Great course as an introductory to Machine Learning.If you are interested, and want to learn more about the proof and in-depth mathematics behind, go to Stanford's site for this course. There are lecture notes, slides and exercises that students use when taking the course at Stanford.",5
machine-learning,Octave is so ridicules! It is better to be more practical and have a connection to real world applications.,4
machine-learning,"Great course which includes a lot of practical exerces, highly recommended.",5
machine-learning,"A brilliant introduction to the field of machine learning, focusing on both the theoretical as well as practical aspects.",5
machine-learning,Just like studying in the University,5
machine-learning,"I learn a lot from this lecture, and thanks.",5
machine-learning,I missed some videos showing how to do the matrix manipulations we need for the ML algorithms using matlab/octave...not talking about a generic introduction to it but something specific to what we are trying to implement in the assignments...,4
machine-learning,"My first MOOC, I was dead impressed",5
machine-learning,a must course for every engg,5
machine-learning,"Extremely good introduction and overview of up-to-date machine learning methods. Andrew had simple and clear explanations and the exercises were challenging, not overwhelming, well-structured, and allowed the students to apply the relevant theory without being burdened by creating their own test programs or mastering the programming/scripting language.",5
machine-learning,Divertido y con posibilidad de planificarse sin restricciones.,5
machine-learning,Amazing lectures!,5
machine-learning,This is the first course i take from coursera. How excited i am. Though hurried through some part of the material due to limited time I learned a lot. Lot of thanks to professor 吴恩达。Time for me to pick up another course,5
machine-learning,"Amazing Instructor. Every MOOC instructor should watch a few videos of Andrew teaching ML.Sharing Personal experiences, providing industry insights and making the course fun and real life oriented. Using a pen along with slides is very important. Just reading out and explaining slides makes lectures boring and many students drop out of courses for this reason.",5
machine-learning,Fantastic course! Easy to follow and extremely well set up. A mathematical mindset definitely makes the course a lot more comprehensible.,5
machine-learning,Really great teacher. Examples and Tutorials are great too. Some typos and missing explanations but thats part of every learning process :-),4
machine-learning,"wonderful course, easy to follow, and homeworks are thoughtfully made.",5
machine-learning,"First of all, this course is a quality product: lectures are clear and effective and exercises are challenging enough. Perhaps the conclusion ""now you can consider yourself an expert in machine learning techniques"" is a slight exaggeration but, certainly, you are made aware of those techniques enough to think about using them effectively and getting some results.And, as an added bonus, you will learn the basics of Octave/MATLAB, which is not a bad thing since, as stated in the course, they are great prototyping tools.It's certainly a recommended course for whoever deals with data analysis problems, where perhaps a killer machine learning system is not the priority but some solid conclusions about the data are essential.",5
machine-learning,"Really well structured. Very clear and concise lectures.Interesting and useful assignments - much better than multiple-choice questions, whilst still being correctable by software.",5
machine-learning,"niceIt's a prefect class, Excellent!",5
machine-learning,This course is very helpful and inspiring for both beginners and practitioners of ML work.,5
machine-learning,It is a very useful course!,5
machine-learning,Excellent course. Good balance between lectures and exercises.,5
machine-learning,"Great teacher, amazing examples, fantastic methods, are what the course supplies. Thanks much!",5
machine-learning,Thank you very much!,5
machine-learning,Incrível !!!!,5
machine-learning,Andrew Ng walks you through some complex material in a way that makes it easy to grasp the basic notions. The assignments are very well documented and the code skeleton that's provided makes it easy to complete them (maybe a bit too easy - someone would have a rough awaking when having to code all this from scratch again as they apply it to their real jobs).,4
machine-learning,it's in a very accommodating pace,5
machine-learning,Thank you Andrew for this very interesting course !,5
machine-learning,A good course to learn the actual machine learning methods,5
machine-learning,Great course to begin with machine learning. DO complete the exercises! They are the essence of this course.,5
machine-learning,Un curso muy completo. Se profundiza en los detalles de construcción de todos los algoritmos de aprendizaje automático pero dejando claro los objetivos y forma de trabajo de cada uno de ellos. El profesor es muy bueno. Aconsejo hacerlo.,5
machine-learning,"This class was very useful introduction to machine learning. It goes into some detail in many common algorithms and the programming assignments make you more familiar with them, but the assignments were not overly tedious. I was familiar with much of the material already, but I learned a lot of practical tips and tricks that I wasn't aware of.",5
machine-learning,Very clear. very helpful.,5
machine-learning,"This course is simply amazing, all the content from the video lessons, through the quizzes and the programming exercises are really well done, and also, there are really good mentors helping on the Discussion areas. If one with the will to really dive into these complex things to extract knowledge, I assure you, you will. The course is well made, but doesn't mean it's easy. I questioned myself through a lot of times in the beginning if I really was capable of learning all of this stuff. But I didn't give up, and well, this might be one of the most important decisions I've made in my life. This course aroused in me the passion to carry this knowledge, and keep improving it through my career.",5
machine-learning,"Really good course. But I'd like to see a final review at the end of the course about the available Machine Learning libraries for MATLAB, Python, Apache Spark and/or JAVA.",5
machine-learning,Thank you Sir for this amazing class. You really have increased my passion on machine learning.,5
machine-learning,Easy to learn and useful to learn.Excellent!,5

machine-learning,Excellent.........,5
machine-learning,"Very good course, gives an excellent theoretical overview of linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, as well as practical tips to make them work well on ""real life"" datasets.Thank you for the course.",5
machine-learning,"It's wonderful, thank you Andrew.",5
machine-learning,Bravo!,5
machine-learning,"Excellent introduction to Machine Learning!Prof Ng is amazingly clear and well articulated. He capture the essence of the concepts and present them in a few easy to grasp lectures.I would have like to have some basic introduction to deep belief systems, but it would probably have been too much... A future course on coursera from Prof Ng maybe? ;-)",5
machine-learning,Nice lectures...really appreciable,5
machine-learning,"Highly recommended if you want to acquire a working knowledge in this area.This is probably the most difficult course I have ever survived and one of the best taught. Specifically, by providing the students with working learning machines or almost working learning machines that require some specific actions to make operational, Dr. Ng and the mentors tie the conceptual lesson from the lectures to working hardware. It would take years to gain the working experience that this course offers if you needed to assemble these machines on your own. I am incredibly impressed (and grateful). An added benefit was new perspective the course offered on familiar statistical procedures.",5
machine-learning,"Andrew Ng is a great teacher. I find this course helpful to understand basic Machine Learning, linear algebra and Octave programming. Also many thanks to community and mentors.",5
machine-learning,"Interesting course format (quizes in videos, programming homeworks graded via provided unit testing mechanism) and the fact that prof. Ng explains complicated stuff clearly and really well makes this course one of the best courses I've seen so far. It is a pleasure to learn things this way :)",5
machine-learning,Great course. Would like to have this teacher on my university),5
machine-learning,I did master's in controls theory and still a very informative course so far. Dr. Ng sometimes omits derivation for some of the formulas but this can be done by a little bit of research into the topic from other sources.,5
machine-learning,"I really enjoyed this course. It is clearly explained, progressively brining the student from the high level intuition to the implementation details.",5
machine-learning,wonderful ! I learn it for about one month and now i love machine learning .,5
machine-learning,This Cause is easy to understanding and practical.,4
machine-learning,I reviewed all the lectures before my job interviews. Perfect online course!,5
machine-learning,It goes step by step leading you to a clear understanding of the subject. The assignments proposes you a challenge which inspires you to get good solutions. I've learnt a lot from thhis course. Thank you!,5
machine-learning,"I thought this was an excellent course and only have positive feedback for it. The lecture contents were interesting and well tied to exercise questions and programming assignments. The programming assignments were challenging overall but forced me to really learn the details of each machine learning algorithm. When things got a little too frustrating, such as for the neural network backpropagation assignment, the forums provided ample direction for me to move forward.",5
machine-learning,"Good explanations by a teacher that knows a lot about the subject, it was a big learning for me.",5
machine-learning,"A good introduction to the subject. Holds your hand through the programming exercises, which is good for people with little background in programming.",4
machine-learning,Very interesting and well conducted. Highly informative.,5
machine-learning,"The video lectures are informative. As a student, I am also expecting to see its applications in various fields with sample codes if possible to practice the theory.",4
machine-learning,I have never attended a more interesting and well thought class (online or offline) before!,5
machine-learning,The best course in my life.Simply super.Now i am choosing ML as my career.Thanks to ng for this fantastic course.Expecting a future course in DEEP LEARNING.Waiting for it.,5
machine-learning,"intuitive, practical, impressive and refined introduction to machine learning.",4
machine-learning,Very good lessons. Pay atention and understand untuitively.,5
machine-learning,Practical explanationWell designed exercicesInteresting and useful,5
machine-learning,"The course is a ""Life - Changer"" ! Andrew Ng is the best professor I have ever had. He is the reason I have decided to pursue my masters in machine learning. He breaks a complex concept down into chunks which are simpler to understand and thereby explaining that concept. I feel like I can apply this knowledge to any domain, be it robotics, finance, biology, etc. Do go for this course, because it'll change your life. It has changed mine.",5
machine-learning,Excellent class !,5
machine-learning,Andrew Ng is excellent in teaching complex material in a simple approachable format. Thank you Andrew.,5

machine-learning,Maybe it's the best online course in my life.,5
machine-learning,"Well structures, nicely narrated class! Would recommend to anyone with basic knowledge of linear algebra and programming, especially because it is a really ""hot topic"" right now.",5
machine-learning,Thank you!!! It was very interesting and it was worth the spent time.It may be slightly better if it would use R language instead of Octave. But this is only my opinion.Thank you so much!!!,5
machine-learning,pretty good!,5
machine-learning,"I would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Ng for such an excellent course. It helped me to get through such enlightening subject. The instructor was very clear. The contents and other support materials are well organized and satisfying. The programming assignments are suitable even for the ones who have little knowledge on MATLAB/Octave, since it is required only to fulfill the core parts. I hope finding more courses like this on Coursera.",5
machine-learning,"It is worthwhile to spend your time and energy on this course if you're interested in this field. Prof. Ng has prepared many materials, including application cases in Silicon Valley, to illustrate the essence of machine learning. During the lectures, he was stick to the basic optimization concept, to minimize the cost function under constraints, which could answer many theoretic questions posed by beginners.",5
machine-learning,"Pédagogiquement parfait ! Entre l'anglais et les maths j'avais peur de ne pas m'en sortir, mais le fil conducteur est tellement bien rodé qu'on comprend toujours toutes les notions. C'est une autre paire de manche pour les appliquer parfois, mais un peu de calme et de logique et on s'en sort, super cours ! Vraiment génial !",5
machine-learning,Amazing course!!! Thanks Andrew Ng.,5
machine-learning,Great course EVER!,5
machine-learning,One of the excellent class i have ever taken. This course covers very wide topic in the machine learning subject. When i have enrolled for this course i haven't any idea about this subject. Now i have understood the concepts behind the machine learning and i am confident that i can build upon. Thanks to Prof.Ng for his excellent presentation avoiding complicated mathematical backgrounds to make the subject exciting. Thanks to coursera team members to include a course like this. Overall i have enjoyed.,5
machine-learning,"Excellent course! Challenging, fun and I am learning a lot of tools that can be potentially very powerful.",5
machine-learning,Top!,5
machine-learning,Great insights into machine learning. A well paced course with the right level of details on motivation for each of the algorithm - fantastic course.,5
machine-learning,Not yet finished. but really informative and simple for a layman. Leaves a lot of room for building up on concepts.,5
machine-learning,Great intro to machine learning.,5
machine-learning,"Very nice course, instructive and accessible to anyone.",5
machine-learning,Very good and balanced introduction into machine learning.I would suggest everyone who wants to get in touch with ML to start with Andrew Ng course.,5
machine-learning,Very interesting and useful course,5
machine-learning,"This is a survey course in Machine Learning which isn't afraid to get seriously in-depth with the detailed math and coding techniques underlying popular ML topics like logistic regression, neural networks, and SVMs. Andrew Ng also spends considerable time on applications and methods for determining if your learner is robust. It is a very challenging course, both conceptually and with the assignments. The assignments are very difficult and will require considerable time and effort. Previous experience with Matlab/Octave is helpful. In terms of math, I think at least one course in Linear Algebra should be prerequisite as the use of vector and matrix operations abound in this class. A good understanding of the programming concept of vectorization is also very helpful...if you don't already understand it...you will after you get through this course. A special thanks to Tom Mosher, one of the class mentors....his help and advice was very helpful in completing the course.",4
machine-learning,"Though Andrew Ng eschews mathematical detail in the beginning, I am finding that this survey style course was a really nice introduction to how people approach problems in ML and practically use ML.",5
machine-learning,I enjoy a lot taking this course. I would like to thank the teacher for making it easier. I was looking forward to watching the next video. I feel I get the foundations for my postgraduate studies.,5
machine-learning,"Great overall experience. The lectures are top notch. The section on backward propagation in neural nets was particularly well done. You spend most of the homeworks getting Octave implementations to work based on provided scaffolding code. This is a good method, but it does mean that you spend time with few examples than you might expect, as you must write the implementations at a fairly low level. The upside is that you end up with a deeper understanding of the methods than you might get from, say, using high-level commands in R.Thank you mister Ng for making this great opportunity to learn machine learning for free.",5
machine-learning,All the maths is explained from basic principles. Plenty of examples and active help from assistants on forums.,5

machine-learning,"Fantastic! And many thanks to you, guys! This course is an incredible opportunity for learning this amazing subject from the best.",5
machine-learning,"Andrew was great, I had no previous experience in linear algebra or Octave/Matlab but was still able to complete all the homework and follow along with the videos, due in no small part to Mr. Ng's patient and approachable teaching style. The online mentors also proved to be invaluable. One of the best courses on hard science I have taken, online or in ""real life"" college.",5
machine-learning,"+: Great deal of useful knowledge conveyed, explanations step by step, quizzes during videos, assignments challenging but doable, awesome assignment submission tool via Octave (makes fun seeing it work :) )-: Videoquality",4
machine-learning,"Andrew is very competent in his job of teaching a very complex idea in a way that you look at it and say ""hey, this is really clever, actually, it is actually simple, it is soo simple that I don't understand why it is not common knowledge"".The course is just this good.",5

machine-learning,"A great online course! While taking this facinating course I have found myself discussing the content with several of my friends which is normally not possible when studying such geeky topics. You will get a much better sense of what is possible and what is still not possible, how long it takes to implement, how to do it, etc. This is much more useful as an introduction to machine learning than reading a book.",5
machine-learning,Great Course!!,5
machine-learning,"All the course is very, very interesting and inspiring.I just would like to explore and practice more some optimization routines we used on some programming exercises.I also would like to watch at least some words of frequent itemset mining. IMHO, it is a relevant mining task very useful in some real problems.Congratulations to prof. Andrew and all of his team/staff.",5

machine-learning,"Andrew is a great teacher, making this course so interesting.",5
machine-learning,easy to understand and helpful.,5
machine-learning,"I really enjoyed the class, and I feel like I learned a lot! I'd have given it 5 stars, but there's there are parts of the homework asignments that aren't well organized, for example I didn't know about the unit tests in the discussion threads for a while, and there's more detailed descriptions of the programming sections but they're really hard to find. All in all, a really good experience though.",4
machine-learning,"Clear and useful, a good choice for new learner",5
machine-learning,Why dont you open week2 and rest of the weeks ?? Why the hell are you blocking my learning until ???,1
machine-learning,Very clear and informative.,5
machine-learning,"Great course! Main points I found useful:1. Actually implementing the cost functions and gradients in MATLAB really made the formulae sink in.2. Bias-variance trade off: plot the learning curve of train & CV error vs number of samples to determine whether you have a low bias algo. If not, going 'big data' won't help.3. Ceiling analysis to figure out which areas to spend effort on improving.",5
machine-learning,"Excellent course, I've learned a lot. It introduced me to the Machine Learning world.",5
machine-learning,Excellent course to get an understanding on how Machine learning works. Enough detail to get you going on building your own algorithms.,5
machine-learning,very good~~~~,5
machine-learning,Very very interesting course with a very inspiring teacher! Many thanks!!,5
machine-learning,"Extremely well structured and well taught course. Andrew Ng is fabulous in the way in which he encourages and explains through ""intuitions"". The programming assignments are well designed to focus on the maths rather than the coding.",5
machine-learning,"This is one of the best courses on Coursera! I really learn a lot from Prof Ng. The course content is not hard for beginner, but it doen't mean trival. It covers mOst of the basic knowledges of Machine Learning. I hope Prof Ng can give advanced version of Machine Learning in the future.",5
machine-learning,"It is very interesting course, thank you professor Andre Ng and mentor Tom Mosher, highly recommended!",5
machine-learning,It was really helpful educating course thank to University of Stanford and thank to Mr Andrew Ng,5
machine-learning,swag,5
machine-learning,very clear. easy to get hands on!,5
machine-learning,Very Good course for a beginner to learn Machine learning.,5
machine-learning,"A great course with a great Instructor. It takes quite some effort to go through all the lectures and do all assignments, but it is definitely worth the effort.",5
machine-learning,great ml course.,5
machine-learning,Wonderful course which helped me a lot in my research. I thank Professor Andrew NG for great contribution towards the course. Special thanks for Coursera giving such a course for free.,5
machine-learning,"Really great course. The lectures were instructive and detailed without wasting time. The quizes tested well that you understood the material, and the assignments made you learn not just how to do machine learning but how to do it well and intelligently.I can't imagine a better way to learn Machine Learning than with this course. The only potential negative is that those of us like me who started this course being terrible at matlab/octave have to become competent in it to succeed.I highly recommend this course to anybody who wants to learn Machine Learning. There isn't a better resource out there.",5
machine-learning,An eye opener for me to see the world from different perspective.,5
machine-learning,I like this class.,5
machine-learning,"I have tried and tested multiple courses on machine learning. This course's USP is the in-detail theoretical treatment of the machine learning algorithms with a focus on quick prototyping using a simple language such as Octave. Don't get me wrong - For my purposes, I always prefer Python to R and R to Octave. R and Python might have great ML libraries, but if you wish to get your hands dirty with the engineering behind those algorithms, the build, that is - then Octave is great!. I think it's a much needed skill, to understand the design of these algorithms in greater detail. It's a more liberating experience than being reliant on limited degrees of freedom provided by some packages in R or Python.",5
machine-learning,"Although I've only completed 2 week's of material, I found this to be extremely interesting. The videos are very good, assignments are excellent to better the understanding and the course seems to be understandable if some one has minimum but more than zero knowledge on linear algebra and programming. Great course, truly enjoying as I'm well ahead of my all deadlines :-)",5
machine-learning,Simplifying this complex subject to about a Calculus learning level. If you can do the Calculus they teach in high school you can do this very organized and well though out class.,5
machine-learning,Great course and easy to follow,5
machine-learning,"It's a great machine learning course and Prof. Andrew Ng teaches it well. Thanks for the great course, Prof. Ng. I also hope that you will teach another course on coursera. Many thanks!",5
machine-learning,"This course is very in-depth relative to other courses on Coursera. Professor Ng is very knowledgeable and does a really good job explaining such a difficult concept with zero prior experience. If you are coming into this course with no prior knowledge, you will have to use the discussion forums to do the assignments. Even if you do not know how to do the assignments, you will understand the theory behind the concepts regardless.My only gripe with this course is the use of Matlab or Octave which seems to be outdated.",5
machine-learning,"This course was very nicely done. Dr Ng's videos and narrative were excellent. They were long enough to convey the material properly and short enough not to loose my attention. Assignments were very good as they left you just enough room to fail, learn and ultimately succeed. The quizzes were thought provoking. On the questions that stated ""choose all that apply,"" I would suggest that some form of feedback be provided so that the test taker could know which ones were incorrectly selected/not selected. Perhaps partial credit would be good instead of 0/20 with one wrong selection. Feedback, perhaps an explanation, would be appropriate on all questions incorrectly answered.I would also suggest a pdf document that showed how to do the various matrix operations in octave with an example or two. This would include basic and advanced operations. I know linear algebra, I just didn't know the syntax in octave and this cost me 3-5 hours over the whole course.Now off to do some simple applications here at work like spam filter and anomaly detection to start. Thanks for an excellent course.",5
machine-learning,"Machine Learning is an excellent course with great presentations. This is not an easy course, and I found myself reviewing concepts and being challenged to dive deeper into the material. The assignments are difficult, but the tutorials on the discussion boards from the course mentor made all of the difference. I highly recommend the linear algebra review as well. I now have a much better understanding of how the machine learning algorithms work after having completed the course.",5
machine-learning,Fantastiic,5
machine-learning,Amazing course! Content is easy to follow. Material that seems daunting on first inspection is dissected and presented in a very intuitive way. The quizzes and especially the Octave/Matlab practice problems are extremely helpful to check your understanding. The scripts are organized very clearly and provides insight on how all the modelling steps should be structured. Mentors for the course are exceptionally helpful. I cannot think of a single criticism. It is hard for me to imagine anyone who is interested in machine learning and is new to the subject walking away disappointed. Thank you Andrew Ng!,5
machine-learning,"Professor Andrew got five stars! This course is awesome. Describes several the theories and practices about machine learning, using valuable videos and exercises. High recommend.",5
machine-learning,"Great introduction to Machine Learning! It was really simple to follow. For the practical exercises however, I struggled a bit with the programming language itself rather than with the actual algorithm implementation. It would be also good to have a list of recommended readings.",4
machine-learning,Excelente curso :).,5
machine-learning,Great introductory course to Machine Learning. Gave me great insights into the field. Good job mister Ng,5
machine-learning,"Really interesting course, and well taught.",5
machine-learning,It was a really great course.the lectures given by prof. andraw ng were good and very clear. he explained everything in the best way possible.the quizes weren't very difficult but the programing excercizes were good and taught me a lot.I'm about to finish my Msc in physics after getting Bsc in electrical engineering nd physics and I think that this is one of the courses in which I've learned the most.thank you.,5
machine-learning,Great course for a beginner in Machine Learning.Nice explanation of concepts with good examples followed by programming assignments. I like the way of using an intuition to understand a new learning theory. Questions in quizzes will help check/improve basic concept of the learning algorithms with real world problems.,5
machine-learning,"Excellent teaching skills, course material, hands-on assignments. I wish all my faculty courses were like this. Good job and thank you for this opportunity!",5
machine-learning,Excellent course. My only criticism was that there was perhaps a little too much hand-holding in the assignments. Still learned a ton! Thank you!,4
machine-learning,Easy understandable and persuasive,5
machine-learning,Amazing course and Professor :),5
machine-learning,This by far the best course in MachineLearning..,5
machine-learning,AWSOME!,5
machine-learning,Really impressive! I fully recommend this course to anyone interested in machine learning.,5
machine-learning,This class is a fantastic introduction to machine learning. The concepts are presented using a clear and concise nomenclature that is easy to understand and provide a foundation to move on to more advance topics as the course progresses.In additional to providing a firm foundation in various machine learning algorithms practical examples are developed using Octave/Matlab. Tutorials are provided along the way and help is readily available if you get stuck on a problem.The course also focuses on best practices which are interwoven in various topics throughout the course making the content relevant and practical for solving real world problems.Kudos to Andrew Ng and Coursea.,5
machine-learning,Great overview and intro to ML! Look forward to more advanced course,4
machine-learning,Great introduction to Machine Learning. Prof Ng does a fantastic job breaking down difficult math concepts and machine learning concepts into more accessible ones.

machine-learning,Excellent course covering a wide array of subjects related to machine learning in a concise and informative manner.,5
machine-learning,Amazingly well taught course! Thank you Professor Ng!,5
machine-learning,very fine :),4
machine-learning,"Ng, thank you, great course, great teacher",5
machine-learning,"The class is well organized and Prof Andrew covers many ML topics that are very practical and easily to learn, even for people without any ML experience. I'm pretty sure if we follow the class and finish all the assignments the students should have a very comprehensive view of what ML does and how it can solve the real problem. For more advanced technologies and mathematics proofs, this class does not explore much. However it cannot stop me liking this class!",5
machine-learning,Was using most of the tools but never knew the basics of it. Thanks Andrew NG and team for this wonderful course.,5
machine-learning,Great course highly recommended! Gives great insights!,5
machine-learning,Part of Neural net could be better explained,4
machine-learning,Thoroughly enjoying this course. The delivery of the material makes it both enjoyable and comfortable to learn. I look forward to seeing more from Professor Ng soon.,5
machine-learning,Nice course for to get started on machine learning.,5
machine-learning,Great course. Lot of pragmatic advices.Thank you for your patient anf for sharing.,5
machine-learning,"I liked this course very much:The lectures follow up in a logical, natural way and the topics are very well explained.Personally, I had more problems with the quizzes (5 questions each) than with the programming assignments. The examples were interesting and the instructions so clear and detailed that I found it rather easy to do the programming.Another point that is worth to mention: The instructor, Andrew Ng, has not only an agreeable voice and speaks an easy-to-understand english (important for me as a non-english speaker) - He ""transports"" in addition his own passion for the subject and gives a lot of applicable advices.",5
machine-learning,"a. very good coverage of standard algorithmic approaches.b. good suggestive guidelines on specifics of algorithms like issues / details one need to be careful, need not to bother etc..c. broad coverage of examples..d. tricky questions...good to experience...Overall I liked this course content and the breadth of coverage. Based on the difficulty i experienced let me place some points of improvements that would help every student....e. could have dealt some specific examples in full (from definition to implementation) as part of video lecture which would helped better understanding of the problems, algorithms, impact of specifics, implementation issues, analysis methods, inferences that could be derived, final expected solution.f. expecting feedback on exercises.... not only correct or incorrect but reasoning for the responses could be of great help in better understanding....g. downloadable videos could contain in video quiz...h. Octave content could be increased.....i. audio of the lectures needs fine tuning, hissing sounds could be filtered. For some of the lectures subtitles does not match at all...Thank you very much for coursera....Thank you very much Prof. Andrew Ng.....Looking forward for mor courses related to ML by you....",5
machine-learning,This course show me an amazing picture of machine learning . Thanks for Andrew!,5
machine-learning,"There should be more multiple choice questions; 20+ instead of just 5 questions.There should be more MCQ tests. 5+ instead of just one.There should be more assignments. 3+ instead of just one. Make it one easy, one medium and one hard.There should be more optional assignments. 5+ instead of just one.I know you guys are working hard as it is, but we learn by doing, not by listening or watching. Just food of thought.",4
machine-learning,awesome materials,5
machine-learning,"The course is very good and Prof NG's explanation is also perfect.There could have been some ungraded examples to practice different type of scenarios, to help us understand more.",4

machine-learning,Good course to setup your foundation on Machine Learning,5
machine-learning,"The course isn't very complicated or mathy, it covers the main topics of machine learning theory and provides many illustrative examples. I like the programming assignments most due to completeness of resulting solutions and simplicity of implementation process. Also, I discovered Matlab/Octave as a very laconic programming language/tool to deal with complex numerical problems. Thank you, Andrew Ng and the Course team!",5
machine-learning,"Very helpful and intuitive,I really appreciate these online courses",5
machine-learning,Excellent - found it really helpful,5
machine-learning,Excellent course. Much to learn if done systematically.,5
machine-learning,"The course is more an exercise in flexing Ivy vernacular than it is actually teaching. The learning curve is too steep to be useful to the majority of potential registrants. You're interested in this course either to (a) learn something about an exciting and ever changing field and/or (b) to have the Stanford logo on your LinkedIn profile. In both cases, move on. The curve is far too steep to be useful or to merit the countless additional hours of background learning the course should have done to bridge the gap.",1
machine-learning,Excellent course for getting started on machine learning. Answers and explanations of the quiz after it has been answered would have been a little more helpful. All in all an awesome course! :),5
machine-learning,"Fantastic course. Great mix of practical examples and theory. Good pace in the videos, great organization and clear explanations. The assignments are very well put together: difficult but with different checks built in along to way to help catch programming bugs.",5
machine-learning,"I just thought it would be harder. But then again, maybe I wouldn't have enough time to learn it. It's great.",5
machine-learning,Excellent course to understand the fundamental principles that govern key machine learning algorithms,5

machine-learning,The content of the course and the way it is explained is wonderful.,5
machine-learning,Course is well defined. Exercises are good to learn about what we saw in the videos. Thanks teacher!!,5
machine-learning,Good.. But not latest.,3
machine-learning,"I am week 9 of current course but I already feel so good about the subject. The content covered by Professor and the ease with which he has gone over such complex subjects is beyond commendable. I thoroughly enjoyed the course.I just want Professor Ng to consider another advanced course which covers topics which he hasn't covered in this one, in detail, due to time and audience constraints.Also, there should be an option to get the certificate at the end of the course too, like, in my case, I wasn't sure if I will be able to follow deadlines due to work schedule but now at almost end of it, I feel like I should have opted for it.All in all, thank you so much!",5

machine-learning,Excellent! course by Andrew Ng and Stanford.,5
machine-learning,Great course! Great teacher! There are so many interesting topics within course and many challengeable programming assignments! I adore it!,5
machine-learning,The topics covered are really good. It could have been better if a few of the topics are covered in depth.,4
machine-learning,"One of the best courses that exist, to my knowledge, as far as the educational methods that it uses and the environment that it creates for non-computationally oriented fellows that want to really get started in the field of machine learning...",5
machine-learning,"Half-way between linear algebra and programming, very concrete with the assignments, and the presentation by M. Ng makes the whole course very clear and understandable.I learned a lot, and I am really grateful for all the funny things I am able to do now.I highly recommend this course.",5
machine-learning,"Thank you Mr. Andrew Ng for this great course! Only absolute competence is able to perform very difficult knowledge area in this elegant and easy to understand way.BR, Sergey",5
machine-learning,"Great Course, it`s very important for my study",5
machine-learning,very well put together,5
machine-learning,"Great introduction to Machine Learning. Programming assignments are challenging, but very valuable - clearly a lot of thought went into preparing them. The supporting code for the assignments is also a great reference for future analysis and work.Professor Ng is great. Concretely, he made learning Machine Learning very pleasurable.",5
machine-learning,"BRILLIANT !!!!Andrew Ng is a great teacher. He has really taken a great approach to presenting this course. I learned a whole lot and grasped and retained more only because of his teaching style and methods.This course is a MUST, if you're looking to pick up on Machine Learning concepts or break in to the Data Science industry.",5
machine-learning,Andrew Ng is great!!!,5
machine-learning,"Really well-developed, with lots of energy and structure!",5
machine-learning,Very Basic and good so far for the zero knowledge learners .,5
machine-learning,thank you. i think it is a great lesson. it blows mist away in front of my eyes.,5
machine-learning,Best Coursera containt ... :highfive: Andrew NG,5
machine-learning,Clear and well-designed class,5
machine-learning,Best course I ever taken!,5
machine-learning,"Great material, keep the good work.",5
machine-learning,"good material but sound quality of videos is bad, could use his own machine learning techniques to improve the sound, also no literature which is bad.",4
machine-learning,"Excellent course, assumes nothing, brilliantly explained, comprehensive, fun assignments, Andrew Ng is a hero! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",5
machine-learning,"Good course, clear lectures, good assignments. Wish it was more in depth.",5
machine-learning,It is a good course helping to gain the fundamental knowledge needed to get started with ML..:),5
machine-learning,"This is an excellent course. I'm only part way through, but I feel like I am learning a lot. It is covering the material that it promised in the outline. The pacing is right on. And I've found the quizzes and assignments have really helped me understand the material better.I only have a few minor quibbles.For one, the audio, especially in the early lectures, is rather muffled. This might make the lectures difficult to view in a noisy environment (eg. in a crowded subway car), but it is fine --though a bit of a nuisance-- in a quiet one.Another problem I've noticed is that some of the assignments are ordered in the course listing ahead of the lectures that cover the material (eg. regularization). At worst, this is a nuisance and is easy to work around -- just proceed with the lectures.Overall, I'm very glad to be taking the course and am very satisfied with it so far.",4
machine-learning,Great class! Thanks Dr. Ng and the coursera team!,5
machine-learning,"Best for beginners, covers all aspects including practical applications",5
machine-learning,Well structured course although I do hate the octave and matlab limitation as the only programming language for this course.,4
machine-learning,perfect content and presentation. The professor has an undeniable insight in the subject area.,5
machine-learning,"Very interesting, easy to follow videos (right level of detail on linear algebra) and lots of algorithms, techniques and tips!For the last lessons, however, the practice is a bit ""black box"" where you have everthing initialized and you just plug in your functions, I'd liked more details on how everything was set.",4
machine-learning,A great course.,5
machine-learning,its engaging and creative,5
machine-learning,Truly amazing quality of study that everyone can get from Coursera. Machine Learning topic got very well explained by the Instructor & He is obviously mastering this topic in all dimensions. I am benefited with enormous confidence into Machine learning topics which I would enhance further with practical experience in my field of study.,5
machine-learning,Pros: Really awesome course. Learned a lot from assignments . Andrew sir explained the difficult topics with so ease. Discussion forums helped a lot which i got stuck on particular assignment. The topics are structured well enough to guide step by step learning.Cons: The way this course is framed allows one to add only few lines of code. We don't learn to implement from scratch. I don't feel confident to apply the learned concepts to new real world problem.,5
machine-learning,Highly recommended and enjoyable!,5
machine-learning,"Andrew Ng is literally the best teacher I have ever known. He makes the whole course comprehensible even for a foreigner and newbie like me. Also, the discussions's assistants are extremely dedicated to help. I remember that I was stuck at my first time using MatLab, but as the discussion has the tutorial of the first programming assignment, I now understand vector and matrix multiplication that I have never ever confronted before. I'm 100% looking forward to finishing this course perfectly.",5
machine-learning,Fantastic learning experience. Clear and to the point. The assignments consolidate the lessons.,5
machine-learning,Thank you! I really learned a lot and now I'm more motivated to continue studying ML even more.,5
machine-learning,Mr. Ng is has a teaching talent. Thank God,5
machine-learning,"Course was very well structured and full of practical implementations. However, back propagation algorithm needs more elaboration. Also, there should be some extra videos (non compulsory) for those who want to learn the matrix operations used in algorithms (e.g. covariance defined as X'E(-1)X or use of Eigenvalues in dimentionality reduction). Apart from this, it's the best online course I have taken and it truly deserves to be the largest online course offered.",5
machine-learning,It's a pretty good course. Instructor Dr. Ng is good at machine learning and also good at teaching.,5
machine-learning,very very perfect！！！！！,5
machine-learning,It is amazing.,5
machine-learning,"There are some duplicates within one presentation, so video editing could be done better. However after all, assignments are all well prepared, well explained with some not that much important things already prepared. Multiple algorithms are explained with reasoning about why and when to use it. I recommend this course to others.",5
machine-learning,The best course for machine learning beginner I'd ever seen.,5
machine-learning,It's an awesome course,5
machine-learning,The course is well organized and with good tutors,5

machine-learning,Very nice course! Andrew explains everything clearly and in enough details for anyone to understand. The content is very informative and gives a good coverage of ML algorithms and their applications as well as many practical pieces of advice of how to tune them or where to look for if something does not work.The coding tasks are also extremely useful as they help you try out in practice what you've just learned and help memorize the material better.Thank you Andrew!,5
machine-learning,Very helpful! Like it.,4
machine-learning,"good intro to ML - good balance between theory and real world application;negative: fast moving field, it's getting a bit dated",5
machine-learning,"Andrew Ng is an excellent tutor and has a real talent for exposition. I find I'm getting the depth, rigor and keen interest that this subject commands, but not at the expense of clarity. I also find the quizzes to be conducive to my learning. In a modest number of questions, the most important points are covered completely.",5
machine-learning,Some more help should be provided for solving assignment problems.,5
machine-learning,very informational,5
machine-learning,"Excellent explanations in the video lecture, quizzes that test your understanding of the course material and programming assignments to see how you can actually apply what you've learned. Great course!",5

machine-learning,Simply loved it !,5
machine-learning,"This is the course that made me love Machine Learning, and although perhaps it's not the very best online course available on the subject, it's truly an amazing introduction.",5
machine-learning,"This is a wonderful course and I have learned a lot from it. It deserves its fame. However, I would suggest that it would be great if Coursera could spend some time editing the video because there are several places where Andrew explicitly indicates editing.",5
machine-learning,Too slow,4
machine-learning,Hard but rewarding experience. Extremely valuable and proved to me that MOOCs are indeed something that can be done successfully!,5
machine-learning,Impressive course! The instructor has a unique way of explaining some really complex mathematical notions in a way that you will never forget.,5
machine-learning,"Awesome course and teacher, perfect",5
machine-learning,"This course provides a very structured introduction to the subject of Machine Learning.Every week includes programming assignments in MATLAB/Octave. These come with templates and precise instructions. With a little experience in any programming language the assignments should be no problem. The assignments are well planned to keep the motivation up. Really great job!Learners should be familiar with vectors and matrices. Even though all the concepts are explained, being confident with the math will shorten the time for debugging the code immensely.The course team answers technical and other questions VERY quickly. Thanks again!",5
machine-learning,Best machine learning course. Clear and easy to understand.,5
machine-learning,"Machine Learning is a complete course about the mathematical techniques to make computers learn by themselves. In this course you will study the rationale behind mathematical algorithms and learn how to translate it into computation languages such as Octave or MAtlab. Warning: the course is fast-paced and requires some intermediate level on calculus, programming and algebra. You will be able to pass the course even if you are not pro at that but it will be hard!",4
machine-learning,"Andrew Ng is a wonderful professor who is fully able to make his students understand machine learning concepts. However I would not recommand people who don't know anything about linear algebra to take this course.For French students, two years of scientific ""Classe prépa"" is more than enough to fully understand this course.",5
machine-learning,I learnt a lot of concepts from this course .I think this is the best beginners course on machine learning out there on internet,5
machine-learning,Very Good!!!!,4
machine-learning,"Well-organized and detailed-explained content, user-friendly Matlab code provided.",5

machine-learning,This class is a great place to start with machine learning. Andrew Ng is brilliant!,5
machine-learning,"I would give 4.5 stars but not full marks because I don't believe there is sufficient support for novice programmers. More worked examples earlier on with MatLab would have been invaluable and the first week could have an easy programming project to establish the basics via practical experience rather than lecture.However, I found the material to be otherwise fascinating and inspiring in the potential power of Machine Learning to apply mathematical principles to ameliorate the human condition. This has confirmed the path I have chosen. Thank you.",4
machine-learning,This is an excellent course! It is the second time I take this course and it is getting better with each session. The material is explained very clearly and the concepts are easy to understand. The exercises are challenging and really make you think. All the necessary programs are provided and all you need is the will to learn.Kudos and a big thank you to the professor and to his excellent team!,5

machine-learning,"I would like to show my gratitude to Professor Andrew Ng & Stanford University for conducting this class.It's one the best course that I have come across in my entire life.Also teaching approach adopted by professor, is simply amazing. The way he delivered his lectures by giving real life example (staring with simple to complex), actually makes the learning curve less stiff.Wish I could find more courses like this; especially in the subject of Neural Networking.Best Regards",5
machine-learning,"Poorly described, but versatile in coverage. Could do with accessing Lecture Notes.",3
machine-learning,Simple and comprehensive. A good introductory course to data science,5
machine-learning,"This is by far the best course for people to get knowledge of machine learning in practice, especially for people who are working full day and are not actual students.What I really missed here, is some other topics:1. Bayessian networks.2. Markovian decision processes and Markovian hidden models.3. Deep learning, of course.I guess you cannot really cover all that in one course, but I would gladly see the sequels for this course describing those topics.",5
machine-learning,The course is classic and informative. You can find there are thousands of students all over the world learning this lesson and this phenomenon can certify something.,5
machine-learning,Learn a lot!,5
machine-learning,Andrew Ng did a great job with this course. He covers algorithms and others tools to do machine learning. Being new to machine learning I believe I got an idea what it is about and how to apply the methods.,5

machine-learning,A very good introduction to machine learning concept and the algorithms.,5
machine-learning,so many maths & hardcore foundations it hurts,5
machine-learning,Extremely helpful,5
machine-learning,"This course is absolute garbage. You get no feedback on your quizzes or assignments and the professor is one of the most boring I've ever seen. It's absurdly frustrating to repeatedly fail without any feedback as to why you're failing.The lectures are clearly from a math perspective, as the prof simply draws what he's talking about on the slides. His hand writing is poor, and he does a lackluster job of explaining what exactly he's doing.Finally, pure lecture with no notes is almost impossible to learn, as there's nothing to read and study.I'd rate this course a 1/10, take the course on iTunes from Caltech instead.",1
machine-learning,"Dr Andrew Ang is doing a great job of explaining a very complex problems in a very simple and understandable way.It's not an easy course, especially the exercises. The force you to take that theory you've just learn and apply it to real practical exercises, that's never an easy task :-).That's why this course is so good.",5
machine-learning,"Excellent course, could be helped by having some prerequisites and then dispensing with the parts that breeze very secularly through weighty topics such as Linear Algebra and general interpreter based programming.<3",4
machine-learning,One of the best courses I've attended.,5
machine-learning,Assignments are too easy. I am not able to practice optimization methods implementation (Like - fmincg etc).Video lectures are good but at some places lack the explanation (Like how do we get the cost function of neuralnets). Still very helpful.,3
machine-learning,It is a really good lecture. I will take this course again later to get the certificate. Thanks.,5
machine-learning,Can have a more math background for those who are interested,4
machine-learning,Excellent course to get started with Machine Learning,5

machine-learning,"Amazing. Well organized. More self-paced courses, like this one, should be started.",5
machine-learning,so gr8.It's exactly the mooc I want!!!,5
machine-learning,"Although I have not finished it yet I certanly believe it to be an outstanding course. It gives a good insight into the many aspects comprised by 'Machine Learning'. Obviously is not, and neither intended to be, as comprehensive as it's presential counterpart CS229. In my opinion it offers a good balance of math/theory and some hands on experience in the form of programming assignments.",5
machine-learning,Really solid course for someone who wants to build a solid understanding of the main concepts of machine learning. Definitely learned a lot.,5
machine-learning,"The assignments were the best part of this course. Kudos to Prof. Ng for creating such an interactive course,",5

machine-learning,great course!Angrew Ng is a great scientist and teacher .I love him,5
machine-learning,"Amazing course with easy to follow such a complex stuff. Absolutely great Professor with an great teaching attitude. Instead confusing with endless formulae try to give reasonable example with slowly increasing complexity factor. Just, Great.",5
machine-learning,First session containing the Regression and Gradient descent with 1 variable was a very good session explain the basics very well. Thanks for Andrew for a wonderful session,5
machine-learning,Very nice for learning the basics.,5
machine-learning,"Go in details, the teacher master the course subject and gives some real world advices.",5
machine-learning,"Awesome class. One of the most meaningful compendiums of innovative thought available on-line today. Nice work, Mr. Ng.",5
machine-learning,"The best thing, just after the course when I see the stars to rate the course ML algorithm goes in my mind (Hehe). Super awesome course, right from the basics to deeper. Videos and topics are split in right pieces to keep it interesting. Interesting real world problems solved in programming exercises.",5
machine-learning,"the content is well chosen, easy to understand yet it contains a valuable piece of information",5
machine-learning,Excellent course talking about the fundamentals of machine learning. Definitely worth the time and effort. I would have given it a 5 if it had any information on how to handle non numerical data like categorical or text features.,4

machine-learning,Great Course to start exploring data science,5
machine-learning,Thank you for all.,5
machine-learning,Very good materials and interactive approach!,5
machine-learning,"Overall, an awesome course. It covers many useful algorithms and approaches to machine learning, and presents the material in an easy to understand manner.The assignments really reinforce the material and give you a chance to try out the lessons learned in the lectures.The only downside to this course is that it doesn't cover some of the more theoretical aspects of machine learning. After participating in this course, it is natural to ask ""what questions can't we solve with machine learning?"" ""What defines something as machine learnable?"", or ""What are the mathematics behind this method?""These are small problems with an otherwise amazing course. In fact, I would say that this course is more useful than quite a few you can take an accredited university.",5
machine-learning,"Brilliant course. Masterfully taught, very well structured course that makes optimal use of the online teaching format, and teaches a lot of actually applicable skills if one's willing to put in the effort. I'm kind of at a loss for superlatives reallyI would say it was pure joy taking the course, but there were at least 10% frustration about my code not working or my brain refusing to understand some formula or other. Obviously those moments were worth no less, probably much more than the purely enjoyable and interesting ones in terms of knowledge and skills acquired.Anyone who is relatively new to machine learning - this is the perfect crash course introduction.",5
machine-learning,Very thorough and well taught course. Thank you very much and congratulations.,5
machine-learning,Wonderful lecture with easy understanding way to go into and then master the main algorithms. A lot of practical experiences involving with the algorithms are introduced. Very practical course.,5
machine-learning,Truly amazing !!Learned a lot in this course.,4
machine-learning,great class for a mathematician looking to apply machine learning in the analysis of oil production and demand data,5
machine-learning,i love machine learning. the course structure is awesome,4
machine-learning,Excellent course and instructor. I am proud that I completed successfully its first session back in 2011.,5
machine-learning,Suitable for students with not much mathematics background. Very clear teaching. Assignments are quite helpful for building realstic understanding on algorithms.,5

machine-learning,"Awesome!!!! Rated by lover of Maths, Engineering & Matlab!!!!",5
machine-learning,Muy bueno!!! me viene excelente para el proyecto de grado de mi MBA :D,5
machine-learning,best course for ML!,5
machine-learning,"This course is one of the best I've taken. The videos are very clear, the assignments are challenging, but well within the scope of the course. Mixing great examples in the lectures with very detailed and comprehensive assignments, the student will experiment with several different algorithms for machine learning and understand how to optimize them to each different application. I can't overstate how great this course was!",5
machine-learning,"Lots of great information, a good introduction to machine learning algorithms. I feel confident I can apply what I've learned to real problems and systems. Main complaint is I wish there were more programming exercises on applying ML algorithms to real problems and less on implementing the algorithms that in reality I'm probably going to just use from a library like scikit-learn.",4
machine-learning,Awesome introduction course for ML.,5
machine-learning,Amazing !!,5
machine-learning,Pure essence of awesomeness,5
machine-learning,The best Machine learning course ever. Provides intuition to every concept in this course. Prof. Andrew Ng makes things easier for beginners. Best lectures with fine balance of quiz and assignments. Thanks to Stanford University and prof. Andrew Ng.,5

machine-learning,"Excellent course, easy to understand and contains great examples, but quite demanding, it require quite dedication.",5
machine-learning,The best introduction to machine learning currently available. Absolutely essential.,5
machine-learning,Some bugs but this course is very good,5
machine-learning,The approach used by Stanford is really focussed on theory with a good dose of practise. The practise is due to the use of Octave as programming environment direct and not as troublesome as it would have been when using another programming language like Python or Java.Having a background in linear algebra certainly helps.,5
machine-learning,"The topic is interesting, the course content is presented clearly, and the lectures are informative. While the assignments can be challenging, they really help to reenforce the lessons.From what I gather, the class was recently moved over from an older Coursera model/design. This is frustratingly apparent at times. Some information can be difficult to find, particularly in the Discussion section. I would love to see this class updated to match the quality of some more recent classes I have taken.",4

machine-learning,"Brilliant course! It offers a deep understanding of the subject in a delicate balance between working with the guts of the machine learning algorithms and getting the general picture. Don't begin working on a machine learning project before watching week 6. Or maybe you should, it definitely sinks in more after you've had a go at wasting your time :)",5
machine-learning,"Great instructor, great class, the only reason I don't give 4 stars is that the homework is a bit buggy shall we say. But overall this is a fantastic class, well worth the effort.",4
machine-learning,cool cool cool,5
machine-learning,The way Dr NG gives the mathematical intuition to each of the machine learning algorithm makes me come back to the course. I have already earned a 95% certificate previously and I have come back to take the course.,5
machine-learning,Imprescindible.,5
machine-learning,amazing teaching technique.,5
machine-learning,An amazing course. Andrew Ng does a great job. Really opened a world for me.,5
machine-learning,It is really great and enjoyable. Thank you!,5
machine-learning,"Excellent, informative and fun introduction to machine learning. The programming assignments are carefully designed to incrementally ramp up the difficulty and the nuances of Octave/Matlab relevant to the assignments are explained beforehand. The quality is truly impressive, although I wish there was a little more mathematical depth to some of the lectures. Many derivations and details of linear algebra were kind of glossed over but I understand that there's a lot to cover in a fairly short period of time so it is understandable (and most people probably don't mind it anyway). This is one of the few courses that really keeps me motivated to complete all assignments. Thank you, Prof. Ng.",5
machine-learning,Nothing can beat this ...!,5
machine-learning,"Easy to understand, great",5
machine-learning,"Awesome course, with awesome instructor and TAs. I spent a lot of time on it and learned a lot. Thank you for bring this course to me!",5
machine-learning,"interesting one; go dude, i believe in u",5
machine-learning,Good lecture videos and very good exercises.,5
machine-learning,Incredible Teacher !,5
machine-learning,Great introductory course. Should be learnt in conjunction with another textbook. Prof. Andrew Ng covers a lot of concepts. Some videos though may seem like repetition should be viewed again to understand the concepts advocated by him. I have found it very useful to attend live ML/AI lectures/meetups and then talk to people about this course and discuss some specific topics. It is amazing how much Prof Ng has covered in the videos and exercises.,5
machine-learning,"Excellent course, very well explained with a lot of examples and intuitions. The practical exercises are very well structured to make you think of what you were taught in the class. The teacher explains every part very well with a lot of examples and real case scenarios. If you want to start learning artificial intelligence this is the place to be. There are many algorithms you are taught and many good practices that should be applied to this algorithms to make them effective and performant. Something nice to have, would be the written courses or some paperback with the main ideas, but the videos are downloadable which fills this gap pretty good. Overall this is a nice course and you definitely should attend it if you're new to machine learning or want to better consolidate your knowledge.",5
machine-learning,Useful and inspiring!,5
machine-learning,Really good course! Just wish there was a state of accomplishment.,5
machine-learning,The course has provided the insights into what is machine learning and how machine learning algorithms works. It would be good if it can provide real world problems and how to approach to solve them.,3
machine-learning,Great thoughts & Great teacher.,5
machine-learning,It was a great course for understanding the pipeline of Machine learning.It lacks Math concepts on which machine learning algorithms highly depends on.For learning Math derivations i would suggest learners to watch Stanford Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng on youtube.Thanks,5
machine-learning,exceptionally good and to the point...,5
machine-learning,Perfect.,5
machine-learning,Great course using practical examples.,5
machine-learning,Amazing contentAmazing teacherCool interesting assignmentsGives the big picture necessary to get goingSome more optional videos with more mathematical details would be niceWhy octave instead of python?,5
machine-learning,Andrew Ng is an absolute chief,5
machine-learning,It must be five starts,5
machine-learning,"great class. it gives fun, enjoyable and rewarding learning experience.",5
machine-learning,Awesome course. Enjoying so far,5
machine-learning,"Amazing course! Well worth the time. Opens so many possibilities and springs so many new ideas! Andrew is a great instructor explaining very complex concepts in extremely simple way.One thing I would probably add to the course is something about existing platforms/software for machine learning. It is a bit more on the practical side for the people who will choose not to code the algorithms by themselves but would prefer to use existing solutions.Thank you very much. I also think that thousands of students passing this course every semester is a great tribute to coursera. I am a CEO of a tech company in China and while I could access some of the best education resources financially, I can not afford to do that because of lack of time. Coursera is a great platform that gives me that access. I think for people like me it could also be great to open up some possibility to contribute back to coursera in some way.",5
machine-learning,Excellently done. It is a pleasure for me to participate in it.,5
machine-learning,"Best course ever! Hugely exceed my expectations! What I learned in this course will be very valuable in my future. Thank you, Andrew!",5
machine-learning,Excellent. Very well explained!!!!,5

machine-learning,"Andrew Ng is simply the best professor teaching this subject, especially as an introductory course!",5
machine-learning,This course was awesome,5
machine-learning,A really helpful course!,5
machine-learning,"Great course, it's better if you have some knowledge of advanced calculus and linear algebra. It's not required, but preferred.",5
machine-learning,this is a great course to begin your way in machine learning.,4
machine-learning,Very well taught course.Could have been better if would have been taught using R or Python,4
machine-learning,"Really well taught for a course at this level of complexity. The instructor is very down to Earth, and he connects concepts in a way that brings out the full picture. If you pay attention and invest the time, by the end of the course you can expect to have a solid road map for approaching machine learning problems on your own data sets.",5
machine-learning,The best course taught by the best teacher!,5
machine-learning,The best MOOC about Machine Learning so far!,5
machine-learning,"Excellent course !Good choice of topics, great explanations, I liked that there are many practical tips.I would have liked: less guided programming exercises (the solution was almost given in the comments in the file to write) and larger (the student has to write only small bits of the overall project).I would also have liked recommended links or reading whenever a proof or an explanation of a mathematical result was skipped. I think the choice of what was skipped as too detailed for an intro was good, but would have been nice to have pointers for students who wanted to explore more.",4
machine-learning,"Thank you Andrew, this course really inspire me.",5
machine-learning,"Challenging and demanding, but also excellently prepared course. Complex topics well explained, useful practical examples, getting you as far as to be able to solve your own problems using the methods presented.",5
machine-learning,Undoubtedly the best course for ML beginners!!!,5
machine-learning,"Great course, good lecturer, and also practical and lets you try for yourself and test your gained knowledge.Too bad there is no way to prove that all the assignments were completed successfully and so that I passed the course.",5
machine-learning,"Good course. Introduces the basics well with a good emphasis on the underlying math. Bayesian techniques are missing. Also another suggestion : assignment submission in other languages , especially R - the industry language for prototyping ML algorithms.",3
machine-learning,Subject matter was broken down into bite-size lessons for easier consumption. Really good job taking a complex subject and making it easy to understand. I really learned a lot in this course. Highly recommended!,5
machine-learning,The way the course has been structured is marvelous. I have never been able to grasp something new at such a speed.,5
machine-learning,很不错的机器学习课程,5

machine-learning,Great course for intro to machine learning!,5
machine-learning,This is so far the best online course I have found on Machine Learning. Dr. Andrew Ng is one of the best instructors I have experienced. His command on subject matter and style of teaching is truly amazing. He starts the topic from very basic concepts and gradually transit into most advance concepts but students never lose their interest. For students the comfort level remain the same in the advance level as it was for the basic concepts. I will strongly recommend this course to anyone who is planning to start their carrier in Machine learning. This is so far the best course you can find online and it is FREE. What else you can accept. J��V�C��,5

machine-learning,It really is a great class!,5
machine-learning,"A nice and helpful cousrse, gives many heuristic examples.",5
machine-learning,so well crafted. Some less hand-held problems would be welcome,5
machine-learning,Very good class,5
machine-learning,very clear,5
machine-learning,amazing~,5
machine-learning,One of the best course in machine learning. Thanks Andrew Ng,5
machine-learning,"One of the best course found so far :) - intriguing, interesting, challenging and valuableThanks to ""Andrew Ng""",5
machine-learning,I think this is an overview course about machine learning.,4
machine-learning,Andrew knows how to explain complex matter and make it easy to understand.,5
machine-learning,"Wonderful course!Very clear to understand (I'm a university dropout), all the topics are very well explained with plenty of real life examples. I managed to complete the whole course relying only on my college math ( and I was a bad student )Highly advised to anyone who is interested into Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, great kickstart.",5
machine-learning,"Andrew Ng's passion for the subject of Machine Learning is obvious and infuses every lesson. His wide experience in the field allows him to enhance the video lectures with tips and examples that help him to explain what are often quite complex concepts.The lectures are very well organized, clearly presented and, although they cover some very advanced techniques, are obviously aimed at those new to Machine Learning. The programming asignments include clear and detailed instructions. In fact, if I have one criticism of the course it is that those instructions may actually be a little too detailed - occasionally involving little more than copying and pasting code from the instructions into Octave rather than writing our own scripts.I really enjoyed this course. If you are a beginner, then I think you'll find this is an excellent introduction to Machine Learning. If you have a little more background knowledge then this course will help you consolidate and build on that knowledge.",5
machine-learning,Fun course to take. Sometimes a little bit overexplaining obvious things (due to this it's often convenient to watch videos with 1.5x-2.0x speeds) and hiding quite a great amount of math. Even though it doesn't fulfill all my requirements and demands (that is explaining the nature of method/algorithm and it's derivation) I definitely can understand teacher's focusing on the practical side of the subject.,4
machine-learning,You're the person who makes the world more beautiful ! Dear Andrew Ng,5
machine-learning,A very informative and comprehensible course giving a broad introduction to Machine Learning for Beginners.Hats off to Prof.Andrew Ng.,5
machine-learning,Best and nicest instructor ever!,5
machine-learning,有中文字幕 很棒,5
machine-learning,Thank you！~,5
machine-learning,"The subject of the course concerns how to estimate parameters to make predictions about data and to classify data.The lectures are very clear and the examples are well chosen. The mentor, Tom Mosher, is also diligent, clear, and patient. In addition to the subject matter itself, it is interesting to learn that these are some of the key methods used in Silicon Valley.If you have a strong mathematical background, some of the early lectures are too slow. (On the flip side, for someone with less background, the course is self-contained.) However, by about lecture 3, I was glad I stuck with it. Instructors might consider adding some no-credit quizzes to help people ""place out"" of certain videos. If you can get past the assignment on backprojection for neural networks, you're home free!",5
machine-learning,Very clear explanation. Great assignment exercises. Help you understand the basics of Machine Learning.,5
machine-learning,Super useful,5
machine-learning,It is a good course for new learner in ML,5
machine-learning,I have learned a lot from this course . It's excellent!,5
machine-learning,Professor Andrew Ng is the most didactic teacher I have interacted in the last 20 years.,5
machine-learning,"Before starting this course, I had no previous knowledge of machine learning and I had never programmed in Octave and I have little/no programming skills. This is a 11-week course and so I was not sure if I would make it to the end (or even get through the first week) but I was keen to learn something new.Positive Aspects: The course is extremely well structured, with short videos (and test questions to help us verify if we have understood the concepts), quizzes and assignments. Prof. Andrew Ng presents the concepts (some very difficult) in a clear and almost intuitive manner without going too much into detail with mathematical proofs, making the course accessible to anyone. The mentors were fantastic and provided prompt responses, links to tutorials and test cases, which all helped me get through the course.Negative Aspects: Searching the Discussion Board for something specific was no easy task. I would have liked to have known the answers to some of the questions in the quizzes that I got wrong.What I loved about this course: Learning how powerful vectorization is, it allows us to write several lines of code in one single line and can be much faster than using for-loops. I was wowed several times.Prof. Andrew Ng is a great teacher. He is also extremely humble and very encouraging. During the course he often said, ""It's ok if you don't understand this completely now. It also took me time to figure this out."" This helped me a lot. He also said, ""if you got through the assignments, you should consider yourself an expert!"" and I laughed silly. By no means do I feel like an expert but now I have a basic understanding of the different types of learning algorithms, what they could be used for and more importantly this course has generated a spark in me to use this tool for things that I find interesting and for that I am very grateful. I don't think a teacher has ever thanked me for assisting a class. This is a first-time! So thank you Prof. Andrew Ng and everyone who worked to put this course together. Also, special thanks to Tom Mosher (mentor). My best MOOC so far!",5
machine-learning,"Es un excelente curso, muy bien explicado, de forma sencilla y fácil de entender para el nivel de complejidad que tiene el tema.",5
machine-learning,"Overall this is a really great course.My small criticism: Sometimes I wished for more optional videos containing proofs of the formulas. I often spent all the time watching the videos wondering how we would solve some problem only to be presented with a formula without any explanation where it came from. This is only a small problem because the answer was usually not too hard to find and often even linked in the discussion, but if this information were contained in the course content (e.g. optional videos assuming some linear algebra background), it would be even better.",4
machine-learning,What a great course!,5
machine-learning,This course is very easy to understand. Because of this it's oversimplified,4
machine-learning,This course is very good!,5
machine-learning,Beautifully taught with good examples. One of the best courses for beginners,5

machine-learning,This course opened my eyes on how valuable and structured information can be extracted from large datasets.In this course I learned:-What kind of problems can be solved with machine learning.-What kind of data is useful and how to get and prepare this data (+ Octave/Matlab implementation).-How machine learning algorithms work and how to implement them. And how to tune the parameters of the specific algorithm (+ Octave/Matlab implementation).-How to use different heuristics to evaluate the machine learning algorithms (+ Octave/Matlab implementation).-How to debug and optimize a machine learning system time efficiently (+ Octave/Matlab implementation)..,5
machine-learning,"Content is just great.Just the right level of challenge for me, also.",5
machine-learning,深入浅出,5
machine-learning,"This course is excellent and covers many topics, I recommend it.We are never lost during the videos because the motivations are well explained.Furthermore Andrew Ng speaks very clearly and is easily understood by a non native English speaker like me.I liked particularly the practical advices with the common mistakes that we should avoid.I don't give 5 stars just because it lacks a follow-up in order to go deeply to the subject, with a kind of final project and a certificate given in case of success.Maybe I should also have a look at the corresponding Stanford course which is supposed to be more complete than the online one.",4
machine-learning,Awesome MOOC with very clear explanations :),5
machine-learning,Excellent tutorial! I learnt a lot and had a lot of fun learning about machine learning.Thank you!,5
machine-learning,"Thank you for all your work, professor!!!",5

machine-learning,is very useful and interesting. But it has high level,2
machine-learning,"Take this course right now!. It will leave you with working knowledge. So get in there, study the concepts and do the work. Fantastic course. If a signature track certificate came out, I'd take it again on an instant and if Andrew Ng made coursera course out of his deep learning Stanford site I'd be there in a heart beat.",5
machine-learning,Maching learning is a quite interesting course with so much information. I believed that I have made greate progress in this field.,5
machine-learning,great course :D,5

machine-learning,"High quality human learning :-).Priceless practical advises, wide range of topics, well designed assignments.Highly recommended.",5
machine-learning,Awesome.,5
machine-learning,"This course is a highly valuable one. It has been organized extremely well. The instructor provides a lot of motivation around Machine Learning and its uses and explains everything in a very simplistic way that even a non Linear-Algebra expert can understand. Furthermore, there were also mentors that had been really helpful by responding to questions and providing unit tests and test cases for the programming assignments in order to make the debugging an easier task for those attending the course.",5
machine-learning,"Would be nice to have lessons handsout if we do not want to watch the videos, the exercices are very well done so far. Very good course",4

machine-learning,"When you sense a passion about teaching over net, than you are 100% that you're on the right place, on the right time! :)",5
machine-learning,"I give this course 4 stars as I did learn a lot from it, and thought most of it is well prepared and useful.I found some disappointment in some of the programming assignments where I wanted to understand the code better but it was not documented properly. In such cases the common response was that the material goes beyond the scope of the course.I thank Andrew Ng for the material and hope this gets resolved in the future.",4
machine-learning,nice teacher,5
machine-learning,Awesome course with clear understanding!,5
machine-learning,This was by far the best class I have had so far on Coursera. I feel that I now have a really good understanding of linear and logistic regression and neural networks as well as the other learning methods that we touched upon. I thought that the quizzes and assignments were very appropriate and helped me to further cement my understanding that I gained through watching the video. Professor Ang explains the material very clearly. I always walked away feeling that any questions I might have were answered completely in the videos or in the discussions. I would highly recommend this class to anyone who wants to have a good understanding of Machine Learning.,5
machine-learning,very goodThank you sir,5
machine-learning,I like !,5
machine-learning,the best ever,5
machine-learning,Excellent hands-on course!,5

It's very well laid out with real-world practical exercise after every lecture! Andrew Ng really did a great job with this course. I recommend this course to everyone interested in ML !",5
machine-learning,It was honor,5
machine-learning,"My review concerns partially the course and partially the Coursera concept as this was my first on-line course and I cannot distinguish between those two.My experience was simply great, I felt that it was time well spend, for example compares to my company provided trainings and I'm hoping to return to another course.I have quite strong background in statistics so some parts were too basic for me but being able to speed the videos up is neat and it opens the course to wide spectrum of students (again opposed to company provided trainings or even school lessons where in the best case half of the students are bored of the slow tempo and other half isn't able to keep up with the same tempo). To have my own timeplan also helps but I even finished quite early as it was so fun.About the course contend: Andrew Ng prepared great lessons, all was pretty well explained (even when he cannot use some ""advanced math"" not to lose part of the students). The examples were illustrative as well as realistic (at least seemed realistic and that makes it more exciting than some artificial ones).I was little afraid of the programming exercises as I've never worked with Matlab (using mainly R). But now I'm glad that I know another language:) The system of submitting works perfectly.I can say similar thinks about the contend of the exercises as I wrote about examples in lectures. It is nice to program my own spam filter - the concept of programming only some small parts of the program and not to have to deal with data loading, plotting... is again very entertaining and instructive and then it can be done some nice application in short time.My thanks to the whole Coursera team and of course Andrew Ng. Hope to use this cool tools in my work.Zdeněk",5
machine-learning,its so nice. little bit difficult in programing part.,5
machine-learning,Thank you Anderw Ng for the teaching!,5
machine-learning,Brilliantly taught!! Kudos to Andrew Ng and the entire Coursera team,5
machine-learning,Exciting course! Astonishing work to develop all videos and prepared files and guidelines for programming exercices.Andrew Ng make concepts very accessible and very illustrated. The real life exercices immediately give ideas of implementations. We have quickly hands-on thanks to exercices. The diversity of covered fields through the examples taken is quite impressive and useful.I found the difficulty of exercices very subtly tuned to develop really interesting tools thanks to the pre-written codes. These codes also give opportunities to exploit further Octave/Matlab capabilities.I deeply thank the team for granting us access to a such high quality content.,5
machine-learning,"The best course I have found to learn machine learning basics. However, it would have been better if it used python or R.",5

machine-learning,"I really liked the practical orientation of the class : despite being rather short you get to learn about real world applications.Professor Ng did an amazing job on his programming assignments as well : the problems are encapsulated in a framework that effectively hides the low level / checking routines to let us code the logic. If you want to push it further, the whole code is available too.An obvious recommendation :)",5
machine-learning,this course has started new era in field of machine learning... Thanks to Andrew,4
machine-learning,I'm not installing anything. Completely app/cloud-based or forget it. Need to do to the teaching of machine learning what ALEKS is doing to the teaching of mathematics.,1

machine-learning,"Thank you to Andrew Ng for a great ML introductory course for a person with programming background. It gives a very good start for anyone who is clue-less about what ""machine learning"", ""data scientist"", ""neural networks"" etc. really mean. Assignments are designed just right - so that a newbie is not overwhelmed, gets confidence as s/he progresses.As I mentioned I consider it introductory course, because it gives lot of information which you tend to forget as you move through this course. So you need to practice a lot with real life example before you can become an expert.Now the challenge is finding a problem that has not been tackled using ML and trying to tackle it with what I have learned.",4
machine-learning,"best teacher i've ever knownif you try enter machine learning using Bishp (2006), you will know exactly what i mean.",5

If someone wanna be expert at machine learning but he has no background knowledge, taking this coarse is the best way to get started.",5
machine-learning,Very informative and very well done. The instructor does a great job breaking things down.I'd like to suggest better step by step explanation of the formulas and each index and each term clearly; as well as running a simple example and tracing the intermediate variables after each approach is presented. Sometimes the formulas and indices are a little too confusing.Thanks for providing this amazing course.,4
machine-learning,"Other than no certificate, best course ever.",5
machine-learning,"Its very helpful source of knowledge. I am not able to achieve master becoz my financial condition, but i am gainging knowledge here... its helping me a lot.",5

machine-learning,"Excellent course, great instructor!P.S.: I rewrote (and submitted ;)) all assignments up until now (week 7) in Julia (with minor differences) and I would argue that the language is very readable, elegant and well suited for modern scientific computing. I hesitate to upload it to GitHub for obvious reasons, but if you're intereseted, please get in touch.",5
machine-learning,Some courses are well taught on uninteresting subject.Some courses are taught poorly on interesting subject.This is a very well taught course on a very interesting subject.It is one of Coursera's must-check courses.,5
machine-learning,The course is awesome and we need more videos to learn more about the content so clearly. I think lessons about coding in Matlab must be there for the beginners to get familiar with Matlab.,5

machine-learning,Excellent! Strongly suggested to anyone interested in Machine Learning. The explanations has the perfect pace and a lot of intuitions are given to better visualize and remember mathematical formulas. The course does not go very deep in each topic but it gives a wide and general understanding of many tools and algorithms and it is a solid base for further studying.,5
machine-learning,"Learned a lot, hope some additional related courses open",5
machine-learning,the best of best,5
machine-learning,"This course is an excellent introduction to machine learning. Credit goes to Prof Ng for making a complex subject so simple. He made it easy for people without mathematical background to understand the concepts behind the various algorithms. The course covers the core algorithms of machine learning in adequate depth. That level of depth is required to get a good understanding of the concepts surrounding an algorithm. What I find very exciting is that after completing an assignment, one can use the code to solve any problem outside the assignment set. I found it very exciting to use the algorithms to solve external problems including those on Kaggle.I also found the documentation in assignments pdf documents and that in the code very helpful. Great job done there.My recommendation for improving this course would be to include some more algorithms which are commonly mentioned on various forums on the internet e.g. tree based algorithms, random forest etc. Or at least give an introduction to these algorithms for students to then explore them further on their own.",5
machine-learning,The best and the most comprehensive course I've ever taken online :D !!,5

machine-learning,exemplary course! highest score!,5
machine-learning,"Very interesting, though it does not dive deep in the maths. Concepts like ensemble methods are missing.",5
machine-learning,This course is exceptionally well put together. I had this wrong concept that machine learning is a hard nut to crack but Prof. Ng has designed the course in such a way that students get the best out of the machine learning course with fair amount of effort. Nearly to the end of the course. I wish this course was a part of specialization for Machine Learning and AI.,5
machine-learning,Excellent coverage of the subject.,5
machine-learning,"This course is an opportunity to get acquainted with several machine learning techniques, including linear regression, logistic regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), anomaly detection, non-supervised learning (clustering, K-means, etc), recommendation systems and very interesting discussions about batch/mini-batch versus stochastic learning and large-scale learning systems. It does not require a deep knowledge in algebra and calculus (although a solid background in mathematics surely helps a lot) and progresses in a logical manner from easy, standard techniques to advanced ones.If you are new in this realm, this course is comprehensive enough to make you confident to design your own customized algorithms. If you have some experience, you can consolidate your knowledge and benefit from the tips the instructor gives throughout the course. I've been dealing with adaptive filtering for some years and I can say I've enjoyed this course so much. I definitely recommend it!",5
machine-learning,I am really enjoying this course. It's a fun mix of my programming skills and math interests. I Strongly recommend taking Sal Kahn's course on Linear Algebra (@ Khanacademy) or having some Linear Algebra background before taking this course.,4

machine-learning,Machine Learning in Action,5
machine-learning,"I'm currently finishing up week 8 of 11. Ng is a great lecturer, and the course is really well developed and interesting. The first week feels a bit slow, but stick with it and you'll get into some neat math and good algorithmic thinking. The ability to visualize vector and matrix operations will help out a lot, but now is as good a time to learn as ever!",5
machine-learning,An excellent introduction to machine learning for users of many different backgrounds.,5
machine-learning,"A fantastic hands-on introduction to machine learning. A very good balance of theory and math with the hands-on aspect. The math, when it goes into calculus, is there for the interested student but is optional.This course is only introductory and should not be expected to provide anything approaching mastery in machine learning. Such mastery presupposes much deeper math skills than those covered here, along with much greater mastery of whatever language/tool is being used, and deeper knowledge and understanding of many other topics that are either merely touched upon here or skipped entirely. But you have to start somewhere, and this is a very good place to start.A few of the later modules have some very distressing errors in the material that can cause enormous confusion. Otherwise the material is very solid and well-vetted.The instructor is engaging and lively and his enthusiasm is infectious.",5
machine-learning,Very well organized. Amazing!,5
machine-learning,"The Good: This course is a good introduction to fundamental topics and basic techniques in machine learning. I feel that the biggest strength of this course comes from Prof. Ng's suggestions for how to design and improve machine learning systems in practice.The Bad: This course is a few years old, and there are a lot of errors in the videos and even occasionally in the programming exercises as well. In my opinion, there is a little too much hand-holding in the programming exercises, so that while I was able to implement the important bits and pieces of the algorithms, I didn't get much chance to practice the more difficult task of organizing the entire system.The Ambiguous: This course is *very* light on the math, perhaps as light as you could possibly get. I imagine this is a relief for a lot of people, but personally I felt annoyed and even a little patronized with the number of times Prof. Ng said that we ""don't have to worry"" about the mathematical details of different concepts and algorithms. It's fine to skip over derivations and details for the sake of a simple presentation or to emphasize practical application, but surely it is important to go back and see what all this stuff means eventually. I will certainly be looking for other courses on machine learning that give a more mathematical treatment, and I think that anyone who wants to seriously get into ML should probably do the same. On a related note, Prof. Ng takes his time in each video, speaking slowly, repeating different points, and carefully explicating formulas with examples. For some people that may be good, but I found myself frequently skipping ahead in videos because I just wanted to get to the point.",4
machine-learning,I've learned a lot in machine learning by this course!,5

machine-learning,I have been having a great experience learning a new area of study with Dr. Ng's well-explained and well-guided tutorial. My previous knowledge of multiple regression has been enriched by my exposure to the cost function. I am looking forward to how I would end up with this at the end of this course. So far just great! Thank you.,5
machine-learning,对入门很有帮助，很不错的课程,5
machine-learning,Very well put together course. The lectures are logically structured and well presented with lots of meaningful and current examples. The Matlab programming assignments have been well thought out to incrementally step the student up through the different capabilities.'Select All that Apply' quiz questions will likely drive you crazy as there is no feedback on no feedback on failed questions to understand where your mistake(s) was/were which means you spend hours more pouring over the videos/notes to try and better understand possible options for a subsequent attempt.,5
machine-learning,The best course on Machine Learning. Super complete and very well explained the lessons.,5
machine-learning,"This course is the best for those who want to learn and understand machine learning at a good pace. I attended this course for two months this year, was glad to do it till Neural Networks.",5

machine-learning,Beyond my expectation! Such an amazing professor and a great content. This is my first course on machine learning and/or data science and I feel that I am confident to apply it on some small projects. And I am eager to learn more. I am even considering to pursue my masters degree in this area. Thank you Andrew! You are awesome!,5
machine-learning,"first foray into ML and it has been made easy by Prof Ng, alongwith a great introduction to Octave/Matlab.",5
machine-learning,"This is an amazing course. Gives you strong basics of the important techniques and concepts in ML. The assignments help you to understand the small details of implementation.

machine-learning,"Great elementary material, and simple to learn.",5
machine-learning,Awesome course for beginners.,5
machine-learning,"Excellent teacher, very clear explanations.",5
machine-learning,"Excellent course. In the start of this course, I never thought I'd be able to do things I can do, after completing the course. But the only thing that kept me from giving this course a straight five stars is the lack of formal proofs. E.g back-propagation algorithm or PCA. I know this is somewhat advanced Calculus/Linear Algebra topics but it would have been a lot helpful if an optional material was at-least given.",4
machine-learning,Clear and useful,5
machine-learning,"It's amazing, I can learn fanstastic stuff through this free course. There is no boundary. I could implement the machine learning code , and understand well. Thank you so much.",5

machine-learning-data-analysis,Excellet! I highly recommend!,5
machine-learning-data-analysis,Very good. I enjoyed doing it and learned a lot.I would have liked that it had included r as one of the softwares.,4
machine-learning-data-analysis,easy to capture the concept,5
machine-learning-data-analysis,"Excellent introductory course on machine learning focusing on simple linear and multiple regression, lasso regression and k-means clustering. A background in Python programming is useful but not required as the instructors discuss the techniques with annotated code examples.",4
machine-learning-data-analysis,Course could be better,3
machine-learning-data-analysis,"Personally felt this course have a lot more potential. The explanations in the lectures felt very robotic especially when describing the scripts. At times the lectures slides felt like displaying the subtitles and reading off them. A lot more diagrams could have been illustrated for explanations. I have to watch other videos in youtube to get a better grasp of the concepts.Good thing is that this is an introductory course, and the codes are given.",2
machine-learning-data-analysis,"Excellent course, some basic tecniques of Machine Learning are implemented in Python and SAS.",4
machine-learning-data-analysis,Great Class!,5
machine-learning-data-analysis,Very good course. I recommend to anyone who's interested in data analysis and machine learning.,5
machine-learning-data-analysis,short vedios and good ma,5
machine-learning-data-analysis,"Not good at all.We see different processes without anyone making clear the reason why we should apply this processes ,under which conditions and what is the question that we have to answer when we apply these processes.The only good is that we get into some new terms and see new things.I could say that for me,it wouldn't make such a difference if it wasn't in this specialization.",1
machine-learning-data-analysis,"It is very interesting, helpful, useful and wonderful course. Everybody who interesting in statistic must surely learn this course.",5
machine-learning-data-analysis,V,5
machine-learning-data-analysis,Option of learning both SAS and Python is great!,5
machine-learning-data-analysis,Good introduction with python example for famous algorithm such as random forest and k-mean,5
machine-learning-data-analysis,"Actually i want rate 0, as the instruction for the installation of new tools are quite vague and misleading",1
machine-learning-data-analysis,This level of detail was good for easier statistical concepts but there are much better courses on Coursera for Machine Learning,3
machine-learning-data-analysis,It's not an intro class. But you can practice a lot if you know something.,3
machine-learning-data-analysis,Noiiice!,5
machine-learning-data-analysis,"Disadvantages : Lacks Rigour, Lacks Support from instructors , Expensive , Peer review ( this is somewhat bad as most barely give any comments, though towards the end, reviews tend to be pretty good). *** DISCLAIMER *** I am not statistically significant as i only receive 3 reviews per week.Advantages :Quick to earn cert, prewritten code available for easy use. Assignments on your own data. This is probably useful for people wanting to learn techniques for data analysis, who need not go too deep into the technique.I would recommend this to people learning techniques for data analysis in various non-mathematical and non-statistical fields, though the content lacks rigour, and you need outside sources to help understand techniques.This course IS NOT WORTH PAYING USD79, there are definitely other courses much more worth the money. You can audit it for free, if you do not want a cert.",3
machine-learning-data-analysis,More examples in coding and results are expected. So it is more convenient for students to compare different results and understand deeper,4
machine-learning-data-analysis,I would like to have an opportunity to contact my reviews.,4
machine-learning-data-analysis,Not impressed with the teaching style.Seems that lectures were being read and not taught.,1
machine-learning-data-analysis,Not deep enough on diagnostic and interpretation,3
machine-learning-data-analysis,"It was okay for an introduction to the methods, but I would have liked to learn about them in more details, i.e. the course was too short.",3
machine-learning-data-analysis,Excellent course,5
machine-learning-data-analysis,"I really liked this course. Concepts well explained. I was hoping for more practical exercises on different types of data sets along with how to improve model accuracy in various algorithm taught. concept such as pruning etc. were missing. But I am sure in future, we will have more on it. Thanks Professor.",5
practical-machine-learning,Very useful course. Great tutors.,5
practical-machine-learning,"First I want to thank very much the instructor in the online forum. He helped me a lot at the end of the course and his tutorials for gh-pages are excellent. He was also very fast in responding. Thank you.The course did ultimately not really gave me what I was looking for. Maybe too may different facts and not enough depth. I am not sure that I can confidently say that I can build a ML model now. Technically I can, but the deeper understanding is missing. For example: When would I use which method (for example rf versus naive base), the last exercise about cross validation was not fully clear. Using the caret package is too high level for a learner. It would be better to see some more step by step examples. It was not clear to me what the expected error calculation in the last exercise was really looking at. Maybe what is missing a swirl exercises, not using caret. and then explaining how caret can simplify it. We also learned how to create a predictive model, but did not go into how the model gets updated and gets retrained, an important aspect of ML. i also do not see unsupervised learning to be covered.",3
practical-machine-learning,good course,4
practical-machine-learning,Best course of the programme. Simple and explained well.,5
practical-machine-learning,"This is such a cornerstone topic to the Data Science Specialization that I think it deserves a better designed and more polished curriculum. The subject is so extensive that it might be worthy to split the contents in two courses. Finally, I would like to suggest the authors of the course modeling the curriculum following the amazing treatment of the subject found in ""Introduction to Statistical Learning"" by Hastie, Tibshiriani et. al.",3
practical-machine-learning,Really hands-on compact introduction!,5
practical-machine-learning,Jeff Leek is a great professor .The delivery of the course material is very clear and covers a lot of predictive methods by using mainly R's caret package. Recommended for sure.,5
practical-machine-learning,"This course was a big let-down compared to other courses in the specialization. It doesn't seem like a lot of effort went into course planning and creation. Much of the content is unclear and there is little depth. course textbook, and some swirl exercises would have helped.",1
practical-machine-learning,Excelente curso!,5
practical-machine-learning,Very good summary of strengths/weaknesses of various machine learning algorithms. This lecturer's style and production quality is much higher than in the previous two courses in the specialization series.,4
practical-machine-learning,"Yet again an excellent course by Jeff, Roger and Brian. Thank you very much for a well layout course and some good excersizes.",5
practical-machine-learning,"Good course on the whole, learned a lot and enjoyed it, but it would need to be updated and corrected (certain bits of code don't work as they did when the course was produced, which can be pretty confusing). Would be nice also to add some more content at the end of the course : the lecture about unsupervised prediction felt rushed, and a proper conclusion opening up to the rest of the field would be useful. Anyway thanks again for this wonderful learning opportunity, keep it up ! Cheers",4
practical-machine-learning,This course is a good introduction to machine learning algorithms with R,5
practical-machine-learning,"very good, but if it has swirl practice like th other courses it would be perfect.",4
practical-machine-learning,"So why four stars vs five stars, of all the Data Science Certification courses that I have taken: i) some of the examples and quiz challenges don't work as they should, ii) Machine Learning is rapidly changing area - should be updated to reflect this and perhaps a high level taste of Deep Learning, iii) posting the Final Project is overly complicated relative to methods of the other courses - this should be cleaned up - still not clear how point to a github repo link and also have a rendered html page working from that same link - requires two links to present materials and must use default names like index vs. a project name.",4
practical-machine-learning,"Very shallow content - broad, but not deep. Not many assignments instead of the last one. We hear what we heard before. For the same price, Analytics Edge at EdX is far better choice for practical machine learning.",2
practical-machine-learning,excellent!,5
practical-machine-learning,Very useful course to develop level knowledge in machine learning.,4
practical-machine-learning,Very good course. The content can be enriched with some more technical details behind the various techniques. There needs to be 1 more course on Practical Machine Learning in the specialization as 1 course is far too less for such a vast topic.,4
practical-machine-learning,"Nice, clear and concise.",5
practical-machine-learning,Instructor rushes the course and does not explain much in the same level of details as respective quiz requires,3
practical-machine-learning,"Issues of every stage of the construction of learning machine model, as well as issues with several different machine learning methods are well and in fine yet very understandable detail explained.",5
practical-machine-learning,"While the overview of the content seemed very reasonable both in scope and pacing, the lack of swirl exercises meant that the final project for the course was a bit jostling. Overall, I think this course still needs some development in the way of exercises to familiarize the student with the practical exercises associated with machine learning.",3
practical-machine-learning,"mentorship was great, but the video lectures were almost useless.",3
practical-machine-learning,Great course! The hands-on approach make it very useful for one to start doing some very interesting analysis in real life! Thanks a lot! You guys could only make some efforts in updating some classes and packages used in quizzes. But the rest was great!,4
practical-machine-learning,I like initial courses like Exploratory Data Analysis but later on it got harder to follow the lectures. A lot of topics were just rushed through and little effort was made to make them engaging or interesting.,3
practical-machine-learning,"Really enlightening! It has short videos that fully explicate and explain the concepts and also give you code you can use! The code actually works! I would prefer that the instructor get a proper microphone so his voice sounds not so harsh, but this can be forgiven, because the content really is awesome!You can also download all the lectures (and there are transcripts, too), which is great for later reference.Try it - you will like it!",5
practical-machine-learning,"In my opinion, the best course of the entire Data Science Specialization",5
practical-machine-learning,Great course,5
practical-machine-learning,"The videos are really tutorials on R functions for machine learning and data wrangling. A good substitute for ""Machine Learning"" by Andrew Ng in terms of managing data sets and exploratory analysis.",3
practical-machine-learning,PML is a deep subject and this course is an excellent foundation for further studies. Prof Leek has taught brilliantly on the basic concepts of PML given the short time of 4 weeks. You need college level statistics to fully appreciate the theories of the PML's lectures.,5
practical-machine-learning,Nice,5
practical-machine-learning,"One of the best courses in the Data Science Specialization,",5
practical-machine-learning,"Superfluous but the existence of the package ""caret"" covers the gap of other libraries like ""skilearn"" of python",3
practical-machine-learning,"By using the caret package, this course took a very pragmatic approach towards machine learning. It demonstrated how to perform all the essential tasks in making the machine (algorithm) learn from data.In my case, this course required a dedicated time commitment for successful completion. In addition to course lectures, i used the 'Machine Learning with R' book to fill my knowledge gaps. Overall i feels that this course helped me in my journey of gaining a better understanding of this subject.",4
practical-machine-learning,First 3 weeks are manageable and the final project is great! I had a lot of fun :),4
practical-machine-learning,very clear explanation,5
practical-machine-learning,"This course is rather bad, not well rehearsed and hastily delivered. Especially in comparison with other, in-depth course of this Specialization. The course is more of a 'caret' package review then actual Machine Learning. I learned how to use the",2
practical-machine-learning,Top 3 course of this specialization.,5
practical-machine-learning,not what I expected for a machine learning course,2
practical-machine-learning,"excellent course. Be prepared to learn a lot if you work hard and don't give up if you think it is hard, just continue thinking, and interact with other students and tutors + Google and Stackoverflow!",5
practical-machine-learning,Very good overview and straightforward explanations of the different methodologies of ML. Nice tips on how to do ML with R.,5
practical-machine-learning,It was like opening up a door to a whole new world. I have discovered new tools that I will thoroughly enjoy to use for the exploration of data and for predictions. Thanks Team Coursera !,5
practical-machine-learning,"Excellent and useful course.Some of the materials covered in Week 4 should be distributed to earlier week(s). The current Week 4 video coverage, quizzes, and the course project on accelerometer data is too much for the week, esp. if the student has lookup and review some key concepts from the resource links in the video slides. Video lectures are informative and easy to follow, although somewhat rushed in Week 4.",5
practical-machine-learning,"Excellent course, very practical !I am very curious about the maths so I will add some specialized certifications",5
practical-machine-learning,briefly summarised the machine learning algorithms. Good place to start!,4
practical-machine-learning,"Enlightening! Bring together all previous courses, feel now i am ready to try solving some real life Data Science problems. Great course. Thank you JHU team",5
practical-machine-learning,The best,5
practical-machine-learning,Materials in class are not suficient to understand the subject. There is missing swirl excercises and other hands on practical work. In Data Science specialization this one is the one with most space for improvement. Keep the good work. BR,3
practical-machine-learning,Too different for beginners but not deep enough for ones already know R.,3
practical-machine-learning,Excellent course. I feel like i know so much already even though we scratched the tip of the iceberg. Will definitely enroll in more advanced courses.,5
practical-machine-learning,The quiz should be constructed in a way that depends less on the version of the libraries used. The rest of course was excellent.,4
practical-machine-learning,"Awesome course. Jeff Leek does a truly amazing job at explaining very complicated concepts thoroughly and quickly. I'm surprised we went through as much material as we did. Out of the 9, this is one my favorites.",5
practical-machine-learning,"As the title states, very practical way to show you how this is done in R.Most of them are lines of codes and some explanation. There are tons of details behind that and remains un-explained.As other courses in the specialization, students need to do a lot of self-study to further understand machine learning.But at least, learned a lot.",4
practical-machine-learning,My name is Jose Antonio. I am looking for a new Data Scientist career ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseantonio11)I did this course to get new knowledge about Data Science and better understand the technology and your practical applications.The course was excellent and the classes well taught by the Teachers.Congratulations to Coursera team and Teachers.,5
practical-machine-learning,"The topic is too big, for one course from my point of view.",3
practical-machine-learning,"No es un curso en el que se aprenda demasiado.Parece demasiado avanzado en el uso de ""caret"" y en vez de enseñar, parece ser que todo debe ser aprendido con anterioridad.Todo el material adicional que se necesita en el curso, es en general contenido externo.",2
practical-machine-learning,"good course, but one who is serious about data science should view this course as a starting point since machine learning is a semester long course so I'd recommend follow up with machine learning course taught from Andrew Ng out of Stanford",5
practical-machine-learning,"The best course of the specialization along with the statistical inference one - the final assignment is very fun to do, pretty much like a Kaggle competition.",5
practical-machine-learning,Beautiful insight into ML,5
practical-machine-learning,"Great intro to machine learning. Several algorithms with some ideas on sampling and pre-processing techniques are covered. Adding a textbook as done with some of the other data science classes would help, but other resources are referenced.",4
practical-machine-learning,Awesome,5
practical-machine-learning,Great course. Only missing piece is the working information / maths behind the models. But as the name suggests it teaches practical approach towards machine learning.,4
practical-machine-learning,"It very well done, good pace, and gives you real and concrete elements and examples to build a fully functional machine learning algorithm! i recommend this course",5
practical-machine-learning,"Although again very interesting, I found the lack of additional materials such as practical exercises, swirls and a book reduced the depth of the course knowledge for me. Maybe we have been spoiled by the previous courses :-)",3
practical-machine-learning,"Lectures were not very detailed.Quizzes were good and challenging, but too many times the results didn't match the answers even when the random seed was set rightFinal project should have been more challenging with more models to build and compare",4
practical-machine-learning,Good content as an introduction to Machine learning!,5
practical-machine-learning,"Nice introduction to machine learning in R. It is rather basic level, so it not for people that already know some basics related to regression and classification.",5
practical-machine-learning,Wonderful!,5
practical-machine-learning,"Gosh I hated hated hated this course. Nothing to learn here. You will just be given lots of names with no explanation whatsoever.I often felt really angry at the teacher because of the way he would introduce entire prediction models without explaining anything about them. Also, I really didn't like the fact that the course is centered on caret, a ""shortcut"" package to do stuff fast. Before doing things fast I need to know what I am doing! Finally, the quizzes and assignments are completely disconnected from the courses.The worst course I have ever taken on coursera.",1
practical-machine-learning,It's a great course but I hope you add a few things. The course about the machine learning algorithm is so basic. Please get deep into the machine learning algorithm. Then it would become the perfect course.,4
practical-machine-learning,Good enough to open up mind of researcher,3
practical-machine-learning,"This is a part of the data specialization; from afar, I would not be interested in Machine Learning because of this course. I will seek other methods to learn.",2
practical-machine-learning,"Exercises could be more complete, and some are outdated for latest R, giving slightly different results.",3
practical-machine-learning,Fair but assignments are not very well explained,3
practical-machine-learning,Nice Course for every New candidate,4
practical-machine-learning,One of my favorites in the series! What I have been waiting for building up the prerequisite knowledge. Enjoy the instructor!,5
practical-machine-learning,Excellent course for beginner.,5
practical-machine-learning,"Was pretty good, but quite short and some assignments did not align as well with the lecture material as they could have.",4
practical-machine-learning,Lectures are too complicated. I understand that material is not easy and one should do a lot of research and reading to understand the essence of the taught algorithms but the lecturer is also not very helpful and assignments are everywhere on the internet which nobody needs to get tired of thinking a little to do the homework as their product.,3
practical-machine-learning,Unexpectedly challenging and insightful.,5
practical-machine-learning,Quizzes are useful exercises but need to do a lot of self studying.,3
practical-machine-learning,"Rather basic, nevertheless a good introduction to the topic of machine learning with R. Mostly concentrated on applications of the R caret package.",4
practical-machine-learning,"Fun course, also practical and useful",5
practical-machine-learning,"great!!! In this lecture, I learn how to write R code to analyze data with Machine learning methods.",5
practical-machine-learning,"Nice course, Gives a god insight on what can me done with R and Predictions",4
practical-machine-learning,Excellent introductory course to Machine Learning. Very informative materials. Prof. Leek is a great teacher.,5
practical-machine-learning,Excelente curso. Ótimo conhecimento dos instrutores.,4
practical-machine-learning,The machine learning course every Data Scientist should do.,5
practical-machine-learning,"Great course, very demanding, but it could use more reading material, ebooks instead of links on video.",4
practical-machine-learning,"Unlike the rest of the modules in this specialisation, this one was well taught, a good blend of theory and practice and well paced.There were still a few issues with wording in quizzes (and some where there seemed to be two identical answers to one question, where one would be considered right and the other wrong - purely chance). In addition, the lack of consistency in how to submit assignments across the specialisation is frustrating, I'm not sure if it's supposed to be a way to show how to use github or something like that, but it shouldn't be the case.",4
practical-machine-learning,needs more case studies and examples,2
practical-machine-learning,"It's very cookbook driven - it's not a deep dive into the topics. This can be dangerous: a little knowledge and all that. However references for more are provided. If you can imitate the coding examples, you should be OK for the assignments. Fair warning: the quizzes are hard to replicate unless you set up your environment to mirror exactly the version of the packages used in the course.",4
practical-machine-learning,"Very enjoyable and generally quite understandable introduction to machine learnings with hands-on approach through the course project. It was a bit too fast-paced and generic for my liking, but many options were offered and highlighted for finding additional learning documents and courses to be able to deepen the knowledge acquired in this course.",4
practical-machine-learning,Great topic with a great instructor. Only wish the program was a little longer to spend some more time on some of the models.,5
practical-machine-learning,A good introduction to machine learning.,5
practical-machine-learning,"I learned a lot in this class. There are slight gaps from the depth of material covered in the lectures to the quizzes and assignment. If you're good at researching online, you'll be fine.",4
practical-machine-learning,"It's hard as hell, and very good.",5
practical-machine-learning,Just the right level of detail,4
practical-machine-learning,"Good course for learning the basics of the caret package. However, it is not a good course for learning machine learning.",3
practical-machine-learning,"too general no depth, not recommended for science or engineering degree holders",1
practical-machine-learning,Awesome course giving a practical experience of a Data Scientist.Perfect place to get your hands dirty! :),5
practical-machine-learning,Great primer for machine learning with ample additional resources for those who are interested. I feel this course gave me a solid basis to delve deeper into the topic.,5
practical-machine-learning,To be honest I don't think this is worth the money.,1
practical-machine-learning,Great and Excellent thoughts and course material.,5
practical-machine-learning,"Very good content for beginner, lot of learning in machine learning special caret package in R.",5
practical-machine-learning,great course,5
practical-machine-learning,Extremely useful class! Jeff also has many excellent suggestions for resources that will teach you even more about machine learning.,5
practical-machine-learning,introduces lot of machine learning techniques which are used by practitioners !,4
practical-machine-learning,This course allows you to implement practical solutions using machine learning algorithms without having to know the mechanisms behind the calculations in detail. Unfortunately questions in the discussion forum were quite rare and many questions were not resolved during this course.,4
practical-machine-learning,A very good course.,5
practical-machine-learning,"Great course, very high paced with a lot of information. would have been great to add two more weeks and another project to use more machine learning",4
practical-machine-learning,Fantastic class!,5
practical-machine-learning,In my opinion this course is highly technical and demanding in nature compared with the others. The learning experience is good and coursera.org has given a opportunity for customization ! thank you Coursera,4
practical-machine-learning,Great course. I really enjoyed working on the prediction project at the end.,5
practical-machine-learning,"Good material, presented in an organized fashion. I was able to apply what I learned immediately in a work setting.",5
practical-machine-learning,Title says everything. Practically and basically no theory explained. Good course though.,4
practical-machine-learning,"The course is really great, however it should last a little longer, 4 weeks is hard to accomplish",4
practical-machine-learning,Nice learning course,5
practical-machine-learning,Awesome Course !!,5
practical-machine-learning,"useful, no nonsense, recommend",5
practical-machine-learning,Very informative course.,4
practical-machine-learning,too easy,3
practical-machine-learning,One of the most valuable courses in the specialization!,5
practical-machine-learning,good and useful!,5
practical-machine-learning,"As as standalone course on machine learning, it's probably best to take Andrew Ng's class on Coursera. This course mostly teaches the basic usage of the caret package. It is too short to cover more fundamental topics in machine learning, like how to choose an algorithm based on the problem and the data.I took this class just because I was engaged in the Data Science specialization. I wanted to clear the Capstone project and get the Data Science specialization certificate.",3
practical-machine-learning,"I saw two main issues with this course: 1) dated lecture videos, oftentimes with R code that can't be replicated using up-to-date packages, and 2) lack of thoughtful design: example after example after example after example doesn't really teach you anything.",2
practical-machine-learning,Felt difficult in understanding the overall course in short duration . 1 month is not enough for this course. I request the authors to make the course much more simpler,2
practical-machine-learning,Noiiice!,5
practical-machine-learning,"I enjoyed a lot this module, I'll use at my daily work some of the features I learned",5
practical-machine-learning,Excellent introduction to machine learning. I feel that I have a good basic foundation to start building upon.,5
practical-machine-learning,Nice course.,5
practical-machine-learning,johns hopkins' courses very helped me,5
practical-machine-learning,In my view the course was useful but not as good as the previus ones I followed in the specializacion (such as regression models and stat. inference).The subject was too broad and there was no space to cover in detail all the algorithms. Also I think it's a bit out of date because there is no references to xgbboost which is now dominating many Kaggle contests,3
practical-machine-learning,Very little depth. I don't recommend this if you don't already have background in statistics or R. I really didn't learn anything. I mostly just gamed the quizzes and projects.,1
practical-machine-learning,This is a very useful course in Machine Learning that teaches us how to use the R based packages such as CARET for applying machine learning techniques. The course project helps understand how these techniques are applied in real world applications and develop useful insights.,5
practical-machine-learning,Course content feels upside down. You'll learn about machine algorithm specifics and caveats before anyone explains what the said algorithm actually hopes to achieve.,2
practical-machine-learning,Muy buen curso :),4
practical-machine-learning,"The course feels rushed. I understand teaching Machine Learning in 4 weeks is impossible, but then maybe the course needs to have a narrower yet deeper scope rather than throw at you many concepts without details. e.g. trees, random forests, bagging and boosting all in 10 minutes each? Impossible...So, as opposed to creating machine learning intuition I feel the course became an R package code book.",3
practical-machine-learning,"The lectures were great and engaging. I felt like they went too fast. Jeff says at the beginning that this is just an overview and points to some other resources. As an overview, this class works well. You can expect to learn a bit about what machine learning is and how to to do it using the caret package in R.",4
practical-machine-learning,"Of all the JHU Data Science specialization courses I've had, this was by far the most enjoyable. I really liked how the class was more in the style of 'here's some techniques, now do whatever you want on the project.' Prior courses are, and understandably so, more constrained in the assignments. It's not until here that the student really has the tools to be able to flex their analytical muscles, and it pays off.Also, of the three instructors, I am most favorable to Jeff Leek, who teaches this class. He communicates much clearer than Roger Peng or Brian Caffo. I find I learn more from his content than the others.Lastly, I will say that this class doesn't hold a torch to University of Washington's Machine Learning specialization. That's expected since this is one class and that's a whole series of classes. If you're hungry for more after this one, I highly recommend UWash's Machine Learning specialization.",4
practical-machine-learning,I really enjoyed this course. The material was concise and allows me to get up and running with ML.,5
practical-machine-learning,Good overview of available techniques and the Caret package. Will get you started in machine learning.,4
practical-machine-learning,"The quizes do not match a 100% with the lecture videos. There are some weird questions. My algorithms' outputs deviate from answers some times, which is due to different software versions. Quizes are not very educating this time. Courses by Brian Caffo were much better.",3
practical-machine-learning,"Hands-on training, practical introduction to machine learning using R!",5
practical-machine-learning,I like the organisation of the course. The first video is so informative yet so simple. Great resources have been listed in it and so subtly. Also I saw the organization of folders and lecture notes and everything in Github repo for this course. It s awesome. I keep stuff like that.. well numbered and everything. I really appreciate it as it makes life of a student lot easier. Thanks.,5
practical-machine-learning,"Material is very high level. No ppt's are given, so all links presented in the video's cannot be viewed.Quizzes are based upon old packages, so incorrect answers are provided.No replies at discussion board from TA""s or instructors.",1
practical-machine-learning,Principle and practices. Good coverage on topics to get you started!,5
practical-machine-learning,"Nice, other courses will go more in depth though.",4
practical-machine-learning,"With this course, you can develop an important skill for the final steps of a data science project.",5
practical-machine-learning,Need to get more in-depth,2
practical-machine-learning,"Great Course, will be nice to have more projects to see how it goes with different data",4
practical-machine-learning,"I liked the course and found it informative, but wish there were more stuff on unsupervised learning neural network algorithms (SOMs). Learning about most used algos are great, but would also like to know other machine learning algos that are used concurrently.",4
practical-machine-learning,"Useful course that is very practical in teaching tools in R that enable Machine learning. This course is, however, not suitable for people who want to learn theoretical machine learning. For that, learners will find Machine Learning by Andrew Ng a better alternative. However, if you're interested in machine learning packages in R and how to implement them, this course achieves that purpose for you.",5
practical-machine-learning,Very practical and goal-oriented,5
practical-machine-learning,"I want to learn ML in R so I go straight to this course without taking any other course in this specialization, and it doesn't disappoint me. Thanks for a great course!",5
practical-machine-learning,Really Well Structured Course!!,4
practical-machine-learning,Very informative,5
practical-machine-learning,"Good introduction to machine learning, might suffer a bit from trying to cover too much ground in such a short time.",4
practical-machine-learning,The mathematics in this course are at a high level (similar to Statistical Inference) - and are presented at a pace that is challenging without significant background in the field. There is little guidance presented on the methods required. It is recommended that students source out plenty of support material (intro to statistical inference and similar).,2
practical-machine-learning,High level and brief overview but found it informative introduction into machine learning with R. The final project is fun and interesting.,5
practical-machine-learning,"Cannot take the exam, I have to pay... wtf... I will probably pay at the end, but I want to take the class first. Without certificate I cannot prove I took the course.",1
practical-machine-learning,Love it.,5
practical-machine-learning,"Absolutely useless random un-explained list of facts and advices that is thrown to a learner without any attempt to give a systematic approach. Pure waste of time and effort. Can only be suitable to those, who already know the subject well and can use some additional facts that are randomly presented in this ""course"".",2
practical-machine-learning,Very practical tools and also very encouraging!!,5
practical-machine-learning,The instructions for the final project were very unclear and even though I submitted all assignments well before their respective deadlines and reviewed the required number of projects my work was not processed for a grade thereby delaying my specialization completion.,2
practical-machine-learning,Compared to previous two courses in specialization this one is far worse - it is more of excursion into used methods than actual learning using any of mentioned methods in enough detail to be able to do meaningful analyses.,3
practical-machine-learning,"Some of the terms used here vary from the terms used in the industry. For example recall, precision etc. Overall this is a very good course with provides basics of machine learning.",5
practical-machine-learning,"Pretty good overview of how to build some types of machine learning models through the caret library in R, but not much in terms of the theoretical underpinnings or why one method is better than the other or where it is most suitable.",4
practical-machine-learning,"This was a very good introduction to machine learning and how to use machine learning packages in R. It would have been better if the class had been longer than four weeks, but I learned a lot for the length of the course.",5
practical-machine-learning,Fast paced and little focused on the algorithms but quite useful overall.,4
practical-machine-learning,Excellent course with great didactic. Congratulations!,5
practical-machine-learning,Great introduction with a broad set of tools and plenty of resources for more in depth study.,5
practical-machine-learning,"If you have taken Andrew Ng's machine learning class, it's not necessary to take this one.",3
practical-machine-learning,Great introduction to the subject with good classification examples using R.,5
practical-machine-learning,Thank you son much!!!!I really like the course.It help me in my job =),5
practical-machine-learning,Really good class. I think there were some small issues with the class project. Like all real world problems it was not entirely well specified and the data was a bit odd to use for a prediction exercise because it was time series data.,5
practical-machine-learning,A good course where you can learn how ML algorithms work practically.,4
practical-machine-learning,"Made many things clear. Perhaps, the best class in the series.",5
practical-machine-learning,"A great Course, my favorite into the Data Science Specialization",5
practical-machine-learning,Enjoyed without reservation,5
practical-machine-learning,This is by far the most enlightening class in the whole specialization. I really got a good handle about how to build a predictive model and apply it to real datasets.,5
practical-machine-learning,Very good course. I am very knew to this topic but am sure will find a lot of application in my speciality - geophysics,4
practical-machine-learning,"Project description versus requirements were terrible, not sure if the new Coursera format played a role in the issues or not. Quite a few of the homework items require guessing as the answers don't align to the results of the latest tools they have you use. If the first class or three in the series was like this I wouldn't have taken the courses.",1
practical-machine-learning,This is too high level for a machine learning course. You don't exactly learn a lot about the techniques just how to use them and name them out if you're having a conversation with a person. My least favorite course in the series,2
practical-machine-learning,"The course gives a clear explanation of why machine learning, with a goal of prediction, is different from regression. The use of the caret package in R is emphasized. Caret provides a uniform interface to many different machine learning algorithms, leaving no excuse for practitioners not to test a variety of approaches to confirm the robustness of their conclusions.",5
practical-machine-learning,"Had big expectations for this one... really one of the ones to look forward to after working through the beginning of the specialization, but for some reason, it seemed any prof or even TA interaction was absent this time around like in none of the other specialization coursed to date. Bugs in the new interface and quizzes weren't really addressed. Couldn't even get an official response about the apparent removal of Distinction-level now (which I'd been working to get in all specialization courses and now seems no longer an option). Still interesting content. As a ""free"" course, it's still really valuable. As one of the people that paid for this and all others in this specialization, this is the one I felt didn't return as much value to justify the payment with no ""official"" course staff seeming to be involved this round.",2
practical-machine-learning,incomplete and not clear. extremely disappointed.,2
practical-machine-learning,the lack of assisted practices made it harder to digest the contents and methodologies.strongly suggest to develop some practice problems with explanations.,3
practical-machine-learning,"Poor compared with some of the others on this specialisation. The lectures are too fast and high level, with no allowance given for people who are unfamiliar with this area and attempting to learn it.",1
practical-machine-learning,"Wish to have more systematic structure, detail information and hands-on exercises.",4
practical-machine-learning,"I'm somewhat disappointed. I attend almost all other courses in this specialization (except of ""data product"") and this one is, on my opinion, the weakest one. A lot of links to useful information though. This is more reference guide rather than a real training course.I can say even more, initially I start other courses of this specialization just because they were marked as strong prerequisite to this one. For now, I think all other courses of the specialization were much more valuable for me than this one.I've also took Andrew Ng course on Machine Learning in the past, and my learning experience was much better. In lectures on some concepts (like regularization) I'm pretty sure I would not understand anything if I had not been familiar with the subject before..",3
practical-machine-learning,"Class materials and videos are confusing and do not go into enough detail. Assignments require a lot of search of extra information outside course materials. Also, the length that is needed to complete the assignments vary widely week to week.",3
practical-machine-learning,"Great practical whirlwind tour. Light on theory, however, but it's a good entry point to the field. Thumbs up!",5
practical-machine-learning,"Too much surface, not enough depth.",1
practical-machine-learning,"First and foremost I'm so thankful for the exposure to so much material in such a condensed schedule. Very good class. Even though I had to muscle my way through it.I think the class could be improved with one additional discussion thread for the project.A guide similar to the ones created for Inferential Statistics and Regression would also have been very helpful.I benefited immensely from reading parts of the book ""An Introduction to Statistical Learning"" while taking this course.",4
practical-machine-learning,"Does not give much intuition around the subject. I found the lectures a bit uninspiring. Lots of powerpoint (just text, no images or visuals really) and the lecturer just underlined the words he was talking about as he read the powerpoint out. I found the Udacity Intro to Machine Learning course gave a much better intuition and understanding of this subject. We also had slides on how to split data into a training and testing set on pretty much EVERY lecture - what a waste of time!",2
practical-machine-learning,Great course. Really educational and informative. Well taught too!,5
practical-machine-learning,more needs to be taught in class. what is taught is not sufficient for quizzes.,3
practical-machine-learning,Very good!,5
practical-machine-learning,"lecture can be really unclear sometimes because lecturer breezes through the actual implementation of training/predicting: ""use x, y, and z [underlines some stuff on screen]"" and you're doneAlso lots of mistakes/typos in lecture and quizzes",2
practical-machine-learning,"I believe this course is critical and much needed given where the Industry is heading. Prof Leek, has tried his best to explain the concepts in a lucid manner, however the complexity of the content, may challenge most students.A few more examples with R code would have been helpful as translating problem statement to R code may not be intuitive.I would highly recommend that students should plan to study some advance statistics before attempting this course. Having said that, i think this is a wonderful starter course to get a glimpse of what Machine Learning is all about.",3
practical-machine-learning,Really good overview of machine learning techniques and model evaluation.,4
practical-machine-learning,"Thank you for inviting me to be a beta tester for Practical Machine Learning. I completed this course at the beginning of October of this year. When I was asked to be a ""beta tester"" I thought that I would be presented with new materials. However, the only thing that has changed is the look and layout of the Coursera web pages. The video lectures, quizzes, and assignment are the same as they have been for quite some time. Here are some specific comments:1. The video lectures: To me, these are clear and easy to follow. However, like those in the other courses in the Data Science Specialization, this course covers a wide range of subjects but tends not to have much depth. When I compare this and other courses in the specialization to other moocs that I have taken including Machine Learning with Andrew Ng and the Stanford Online EdX Course Statistical Learning with Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani, the somewhat cursory treatment of the topics in the Data Science Specialization becomes more noticeable. Perhaps in the interest of ""truth in advertising"" this course should be called ""A Brief Introduction to Practical Machine Learning."" In the interest of full disclosure, I should note that I have an undergraduate degree in economics and an MS and PhD in psychology with a quantitative bent. I have had lots of statistics courses, especially those related to ANOVA, MANOVA, nonparametric statistics, correlation and regression methods, and structural equation modeling. The latter is important in psychology because researchers in this field like to measure latent variables. I had been an analyst using SPSS for several decades and the courses in this specialization helped me to migrate to R. Also, there have been may new developments that have become more accessible through R packages (like the fancier tree methods) that were not available when I completed my PhD. Thus these courses (and others such as the ones by Ng and Hastie and Tibshirani) have helped me to keep abreast of these developments. So they are good for me, but I wonder to what degree do the courses in the Data Science Specialization actually make a person a ""data scientist?""2. The quizzes: I think these items are good practice and are at a reasonable level of difficulty. However, these items are the same ones that you have been giving for quite some time, with perhaps a few new ones added. A little googling will lead you to the answers to these quizzes posted online. I recommend that you put a little time and effort into writing all new items.3. The final project: Again, this project is good practice and seems to be at a reasonable level of difficulty. And again, this is the same project that appears to have been given at the end of numerous iterations of this course. And again, numerous write-ups for this project can be found online. And again, I would recommend that you put a little time and effort into finding a new data set for people to analyze. This would help minimize some of the rampant cheating that I found in this and in other classes in the specialization.On the subject of cheating, when I was doing the peer grading for the courses in the Specialization, I would enter the code of the students that I was grading into the Google search box and all too often I found links to submissions for the project by students who had taken earlier sessions of the class. That is, students were copying these earlier submissions by other students and submitting them as their own. And I don't mean that they were similar: students were copying other people's work line by line, character by character. I found that to be quite irritating and I always reported it to Coursera. Of course, if the instructors would change their assignments once I a while, then this sort of copying would be impossible. As it is, it appears that the good professors put a lot of time and effort into creating what are indeed a worthwhile set of classes. However, after they created the classes, they seem to have pushed the ""autopilot"" button and gone off to do their day jobs. I would suggest that re-engaging with these courses and reading some of the comments that other students have made would be helpful.Overall, I appreciate the courses in the Data Science Specialization and specifically this course. I know that these class materials took considerable time and efforts to create. I wish the instructors continued success with these classes.",4
practical-machine-learning,A good introductory course for people who has an interest in knowing the principles of machine learning and want to make a step forward. Sufficient details covered throughout the course and additional resources were provided which are very useful. Quizzes were well designed with minor improvements in the accidental mismatch of the answers due to package version issues. Overall the study experience was enjoyable and would definitely recommend to someone who wants to start knowing data science.,4
practical-machine-learning,"Feels like everything is solved using a caret package, while the back-end theory is only slightly touched. By using a single line command solver, student may lack the foundation for harder problems in the real world.",3
real-life-data-science,"Great course, great teachers!",5
real-life-data-science,Excellent,5
real-life-data-science,A bit less engaging than the other parts of the Executive Data Science course.,3
real-life-data-science,this course gave good foundation.,5
real-life-data-science,Thanks for the awesome content!!!,5
real-life-data-science,Very informative course.. ample of examples to relate with topics.,5
real-life-data-science,It was quite hard with all the statistical jargon. Too much theory.,3
real-life-data-science,"This class was bit more difficult than the previous ones and it requires really focused attention on understanding the subject matter. The course is intended to improve your understanding in subjects of surrogate variables, and how to become a better database manager. Excellent course!",5
real-life-data-science,"Brian Caffo does a terrific job teaching some of more advanced material, I very much appreciate his jokes and humor, as well as his helpful explanations of the material.",5
real-life-data-science,very nice course,5
real-life-data-science,Great Course for Learning Data science practical applications.,5
real-life-data-science,"The content was redundant at times, at other the dots that were trying to be connected were to wide apart on the spectrum",2
real-life-data-science,Practical approach and gotchas to consider for doing data science in real life,4
real-life-data-science,Helpful tips for handling problems during the several life cycle stages of a Data Science project.,5
real-life-data-science,Good summary on experimental design.,4
real-life-data-science,"Clear explanation of various concepts with good examples. Of course, reference to some cool cartoons from time to time made the concepts more memorable!",5
real-life-data-science,More real world examples are required,4
real-life-data-science,Lots of useful tips. Great overview spanning data science pitfalls. Impressively concise.,5
real-life-data-science,"Excellent course. The material is good enough that will help me where to look for information, considerations, a",5
real-life-data-science,Much theorical with few examples. Could incorporate examples outside the health world as well.,3
real-life-data-science,Fantastic Course for people who want to know the details to do great analysis and reports,5
real-life-data-science,Some of the material here was repeated from other courses but overall I felt this was my favorite course in the series. I particularly appreciated the real life examples of what can go wrong with data collection and suggestions/best practices for how to handle that. It gave me a lot of ideas for how to deal with some uncertainties I was facing in some of my own research.,4
real-life-data-science,The other courses in the exec series are a little simple. This started to address some core analysis issues and how to address them in a real life situation. A good reminder and thought provoker on what should be trying to do within the enterprise,5
real-life-data-science,Highly educative and recommended,5
real-life-data-science,It's sometimes difficult to follow professors beacuse they take for granted information about the examples they use that is not evident for the learners. They should take a minute to explain a little bit more what the examples consist of and what are the charts they show. As it happens when Brian Caffo explains the blocking adjustments part.,3
real-life-data-science,Nice course thx,5
real-life-data-science,"I missed several concepts to better understand some of the discussions and explanations. It was valid, but I think the statistics background should be better explored.",3
real-life-data-science,"Some good tips, nothing terribly new for those who have had a course in statistics. Materials made easy to digest. The variety from the 3 instructors was nice. Missed opportunity: to combine the best aspects from each. The course notes were either excerpts from R.Peng's books /blogs (good) or automated transcripts (complete with typical AI typos... ""wait"" instead of ""weight""). Some lectures were repetitive from one course to another. Slides with examples were useful, slides with clip-art and comic stips less so. Tries to be something for everyone. Would be better to aim either at former DS analysts aspiring to be managers or seasoned managers trying to better understand DS.",3
real-life-data-science,An amazing course for those who are not very familiar with statistics and a very refreshing perspective for those who actually knows statistics!,5
real-life-data-science,somewhat demanding in some of the points but effective,5
real-life-data-science,A solid course with lots of practical advice.,4
real-life-data-science,Short session need more handson excercise,4
real-life-data-science,Dr.Caffo is really well-versed with his field but I feel like concepts should be given more concrete examples so that they seem more interesting. Respect him all the way!,4
real-life-data-science,"good course, but focus more on inferential analysis than predictive analysis",4
real-life-data-science,"My name is Jose Antonio from Brazil. I am looking for a new Data Scientist career.Please, take a look at my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseantonio11I did this course to get new knowledge about Big Data and better understand the technology and your practical applications.The course was excellent and the classes well taught by teachers.Congratulations to Coursera team and Instructors.Regards",5
real-life-data-science,Excellent experience - I cant wait for the capstone project.,5
real-life-data-science,very boring videos.,2
real-life-data-science,"Brian tries to achieve too much in too little time. It addresses important issues and it gives a good overview, including some hidden gems (Machine Learning vs Stats, for example), but it feels mostly too rushed and superficial for my taste/expectations, and it fails to connect to my previous knowledge (and I have a PhD in Maths, although no strong Stats background), hence little added value for me when I cannot relate to what is being discussed.",3
real-life-data-science,"Is good to have some data science background to enroll in this course, overall still good to learn and get the hint of how real life data scientist life is.",4
real-life-data-science,"Was expecting soo much more from the entire courses. Not a single practical part, soo much talk and write.Sorry would not share the course with friends, 190€ is too much for what I have just learned.",1
real-life-data-science,Like this one as well as the others in the series,5
real-life-data-science,Good Presentation; informative & engaging,5
real-life-data-science,Quality of this course is better than the rest of the specialization.,4
real-life-data-science,"Necessities: practical tools and techniques for managing real life issues with data cleanliness, interpretation of results, report writing, version control. All of them complete necessities for real life commercial projects.",5
real-life-data-science,Too much focus on technicalities - not management based.,2
real-life-data-science,Good review on how to work and interact with the team during the data analysis pipeline!,5
real-life-data-science,"Great information. For real newbies like me, might help to review basic concepts a few times (e.g. what does ""p"" mean? I know it was explained, but didn't grasp it the first time, helps if I hear it a few times, etc.) But, hey, you guys have done a fantastic job pulling all this together and teaching it at the 30,000 ft. view level. So great job.",5
real-life-data-science,"great for existence human and android based life-form simulation internal lifestyle...The course improves life within the simulation 10 fold at least(when combined with the other specialization courses) ...Perfect learning tool for those who have worked professionally in research field sin our simulation and yet now have a touch of ""the turrings"" or you know : CBI...Special thanks to the designers of the course.Top scores for coursera.org &John Hopkins ...",5
real-life-data-science,"Relevant materials, but lecture delivery is rather dry,",3
real-life-data-science,Good concepts - apply to anyone new to data science.Lot of good 'read further' links and materials. Learnt a lot.,4
real-life-data-science,This is really a very nice course for learning data science in solving real life problems.,5
real-life-data-science,"great approach, thanks. A few typos, but otherwise great.",4
real-life-data-science,"Again a course with depth in content but the presentation of the course could improve , it seems a bit patchy and pre-reads would help.",4
real-life-data-science,"Excellent course! The only thing I would say is that many managers from the corporate field simply would find it too ""academic"". But this was a huge plus for me - and I think the course will serve extremely well also to anyone who works in academic research and has to handle some real-life data.",5
real-life-data-science,"Practical using the data science in real life, a lot of extending learning.",5
real-life-data-science,Excellent overview course on Data Science,5
real-life-data-science,Awesome feedback on real life situations where i managed to pass through on my current job.,5
real-life-data-science,"The course tests are at times partially unrelated to the content of the lessons. In the test of Lesson 7 we are asked if removing jargon from an analysis makes the analysis clearer. This is never mentioned in the course.The question does not have a unique yes/no solution. It depends on the context, in particular on the audience of the analysis and report. If I'm talking to technical people who knows a lot about the topic jargon can be useful, on the other hand if jargon is not documented it can be confusing.How are we supposed to know this?This is just one example, but all the courses of the EDS specialisation had these issues. I don't know if it is a language barrier or what but I feel that I didn't have a chance to study more to get a better score. You either happen to have the same idea of the teacher or you don't, and this is not professional.",1
real-life-data-science,"Excellent course, material and superior teaching.",5
real-life-data-science,"wonderful in all ways, I really enjoyed it!",5
real-life-data-science,Short yet nice. Gave me a lot of insights on what can and can't be done.,5
real-life-data-science,Marvelous!,5
real-life-data-science,This was a great final to the Data Science Executive Specialization.,5
real-life-data-science,"Brian, Jeff, and Roger: Thank you very much for all the data science courses, really great. I generally rate them 5 stars. But for this one, I'm giving 3 stars, not because the content is not good (it is; it provides good practical and experiential information), but rather because the material seems repetitive at times either within the same course or with topics in the other courses. Also, the sequencing and lectures seem sometime a bit disjointed.May I humbly suggest an idea: Integrate the key points of this course relating to real-world examples and the sharing of real-world experiences into one of the other courses.Thank you.Robert Al-Jaar, PhDrobert.aljaar@rassociates.biz",3
real-life-data-science,"Very interesting course, I recommend!",5
real-life-data-science,"Too short, too expensive.",3
real-life-data-science,Pretty useful course,4
real-life-data-science,Very practical views,4
real-life-data-science,"Lectures themselves were OK, but presentation needs work. Intro session was very repetitive. Lot of jargon introduced without explanation. Pop-ups w text showed up but disappeared before I was able to finish reading them. Best part of course was actually the text notes at the beginning of each sesssion. A minor nitpick: course description suggests that there are 3 instructors presenting, but I only saw one.",3
real-life-data-science,"The video quality and content were good. Unfortunately, there were a lot of spelling errors and grammatical mistakes in the written portions.",3
real-life-data-science,"The course is a good compilation of essential concepts to avoid pitfalls during analysis. Most material is given a short intro only, so a good data science background is needed to appreciate the material presented here.",5
real-life-data-science,very bad and not organised,1
real-life-data-science,I really enjoyed the comparison of what is ideal vs. what actually happens when it comes to data science. This was a very practical course and gave insight into what to expect from data science and analysis.,4
real-life-data-science,Very nice overview of what can go wrong in a data science project and what to pay attention to.,4

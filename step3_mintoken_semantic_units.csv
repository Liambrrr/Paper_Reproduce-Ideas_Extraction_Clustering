data-science-project,565,capstone project requires work long difficult problem using initiative,5
data-science-project,565,mentors tutors swiftkey employees lacking throughout project,5
data-science-project,565,worked many different r packages generate,5
data-science-project,565,word prediction n grams r tendency run memory,5
data-science-project,565,many students forced use cut version,5
data-science-project,565,three million lines text memory issues,5
data-science-project,565,managed find proverbially needle r packages haystack allowed use entire dataset,5
data-science-project,565,problems publishing presentation rpubs would not work using either rstudio,5

data-science-project,573,providing working next word prediction algorithm eight 8 weeks,3
data-science-project,573,reading academic journal articles watching multiple videos,3
data-science-project,573,another coursera course actually focuses topic,3
data-science-project,573,nlp takes place several courses several months,3
data-science-project,573,),3
data-science-project,573,supposedly work going update course hopefully future students get better experience,3
data-science-project,573,take bit away course especially since made one attempt complete,3
data-science-project,573,however definitely shock find missing things,3
data-science-project,573,one typically finds learning environment descriptive background assistance problems etc,3
data-science-project,573,seeing intents purposes,3
data-science-project,573,even professional world data analysis never experienced lack support found course,3
data-science-project,573,giving three 3 stars,3
data-science-project,573,said learn bit bit struggle required multiple attempts complete,3
data-science-project,573,would better stand alone topic already,3

data-science-project,578,pre processing data quite extensive 9 steps,2
data-science-project,578,generating ngram tables used model key,2
data-science-project,578,getting decent results imho one step quite landmines figure,2
data-science-project,578,problem interesting one ended reworking passing,2
data-science-project,578,95 class specialization didn't get 100,2
data-science-project,578,didn't time implement much figure 'hard knocks',2
data-science-project,579,poor end poor coursera specializations,1
